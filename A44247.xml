            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BEloved and much honoured Brother, though the Lord Jeſus to whom all things are made ſubject, hath ſeparated us by the great Deep, yet I have you oft in remembrance, and cannot forget our alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and indeered love and acquaintance that hath been between us from our childhood, both in the Country, and in the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have a great Family, and like to have, through the Lords bleſſing, a numerous poſterity, and my deſire is to ſhew that I have ſome intereſt in them, being alſo my bone and my fleſh, as <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob:</hi> and I ſuppoſe you will be well pleaſed, if I endeavour in any thing to further them in the knowledge of the Son of God. This I now preſent unto you and them, was done many years ago for the moſt part, as I think, you may remember, and then I made ſome marginal notes to attend upon the ſeveral anſwers to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral queſtions that are propounded in the two firſt parts: ſome things I have ſince added concerning the Covenant of God in Chriſt, made with our Fathers in <hi>Gen</hi> 3.15 and <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. and <hi>Gen</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. This I did becauſe of the errors that get quickning in theſe times, and for the ſame cauſe I have affixed divers other weighty and profitable points in the third part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I hope the whole will be a means to ſhew, that the Covenant of God in Chriſt, is one and the ſame in all ages, though the outward adminiſtration differ, and that the Covenant to Iſrael of old was not onely in the carnal, and fleſhly promiſe and covenant, but alſo in the ſpiritual promiſe and Covenant, even the ſame that is now made with us in the new Teſtament of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God. Dear Brother, and Nephews, you have known my manner of life, ſtudies, and endeavours, and I bleſſe the Lord, I have had comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience of that courſe of ſtudy which I have followed: I mean
<pb facs="tcp:59152:3"/>chiefly of the book called the <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And let me ſpeak as I think, If men would uſe that courſe of ſtudy, together with the bleſſed Scriptures, it would ſettle in us and in our poſterity, the true knowledge of religion, and the certainty of everlaſting ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The whole Scripture and all learning ſhould be contrived unto Chriſt, as Gods ſervant did in the <hi>Conſent</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> did; he drew all the holy ſtory to Chriſt in Acts 7. and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he drew all the Law to Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 doth make it evident, being conferred with Deut. 30.</p>
            <p>Some in New <hi>England</hi> have ſeen this frame of mine, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that it might be made more common by printing, and indeed I cannot write ſo many Copies, as to communicate it to you and to that generation, except it be by Printing. It may be you will marvel I dare be ſo bold as to Print it in this evil time, but indeed I dare not but do it, and I believe this labour of mine will talk with many ſorts of ſpirits, and I hope that Gods people will judge the beſt of this my undertaking: other things I have, if the Lords providence pleaſe ſo to order it, that muſt be made more publick, becauſe I have a great deſire thereby to provoke others to the diligent ſtudy of the bleſſed Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Dear Brother, and much honoured Nephews, as <hi>Salus populi</hi> is the care of Magiſtracy; ſo the edification of the Churches ought to be the painfull care of godly Teachers: and we ought to know that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are little Churches and Common-weals, and the Seminaries of greater Corporations; &amp; that Parents are intruſted with children and ſervants: it is not a ſmall honour that Chriſt hath conferred this truſt on them: and verily, if Families be neglected, the Churches will fail. Let us with all godly induſtry make this promiſe good to our ſelves and poſterity, in <hi>Iſa</hi> 59.21. As for me, <hi>this is my Covenant with them,</hi> ſaith Jehovah, <hi>my ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith Jehovah, from henceforth, and for ever:</hi> and that this promiſe and covenant may be conferred on you, and on your poſterities for ever, is the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate prayer of.</p>

            <p>Wiſdome ſaith, ſhe will teach the ſimple underſtanding: And ſo the fooliſh woman of the ten Tribes pretends to teach the ſimple underſtanding (babbling againſt <hi>Judah</hi>) that they had the truth.</p>
            <p>Wiſdome, ſaith ſhe hath bread and wine for thoſe that do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her.</p>
            <p>The falſe company ſaith, they want not pleaſant bread and ſweet waters for their gueſts.</p>
            <p>The ten Tribes thought the Religion of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves better, ſweeter, and pleaſanter, than the <hi>Eternal</hi> wiſdomes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Temple, unto which they were ſo earneſtly and Pathetically, and comfortably invited, in the nine former chapters of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and by all the Prophets, and were Proud, Scornfull, and ſtubborn Deſpiſers of all the Prophets Admonitions. But what came of all the gueſts that followed this clamorous fooliſh woman? What became of <hi>Jerobams</hi> houſe, of <hi>Baaſaes</hi> of <hi>Omries,</hi> of <hi>Jehues,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his dayes, ſo it hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and will be ſtill, <hi>That Satan transformeth himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angel of light:</hi> So it is not a ſtrange thing, that his Ministers can transform themſelves, as if they were the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Righteouſneſſe. Thus we have a brief Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the <hi>myſterie of godlineſſe,</hi> and of the <hi>myſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and nothing in the world can deſcribe theſe two unto us, but the Holy and Bleſſed Scriptures, and to this day this hath been the Controverſie between Chriſts two faithfull Witneſſes in the Reformed Churches, in their Teaching, Writing, Profeſſion, and Sufferings againſt the falſe Lamb, and his worſhippers.</p>
            <p>Now in this caſe, what ſhould we do, ſay unſtable and

Turciſme is no myſterie, and all the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of errour, is no myſterie.</p>
            <p>Therefore in few words, O ye godly Families, ſtudy the holy Scriptures, they are the Inheritance of all the Iſrael of God. And verily, the moſt faithfull Witneſſe hath ſaid, (and then he ſpake of the old Teſtament) <hi>Ye erre not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God.</hi> Miſbelievers know not God: Wherefore, if ye cry after knowledge, and lift up your voice for underſtanding,<note place="margin">Prov. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Hereby a faithfull mind, that hath his wits exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the word of righteouſneſſe, will often in a day runne over all the Bible in ſundry varieties, if he mark the Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and the chief perſons in the Genealogie: for by marking the times, and the perſons that lived in thoſe times, he will remember their ſtories, as it is common to do in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have not cited every verſe to the chapter I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe I would have the Reader to mark the coherence of things the better, and though the verſe be not named, yet ſome part of the chapter is expreſſed: and you are to remember, that the holy Apoſtles, when they cite a Text, they name onely the Prophet, or more generally the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not naming the Prophet, <hi>Rom. 9.13.15, 17.25. 1 Pet. 2.6 &amp;c.&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And obſerve that Speech, <hi>John 15.25.</hi> The <hi>Pſalms</hi> are called their Law: that term hath deep Meditation; for the term Law comprehends all the Scriptures, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſalvation by Chriſt, and that ſaying of <hi>James 4.5.</hi> Do ye think, that the Scripture ſaith in vain, the ſpirit
<pb facs="tcp:59152:10"/>that dwelleth in us, luſteth to envy, but there is no one particular Text in all the Bible, that hath thoſe words, and yet the whole Book of God (and I think every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prophet) doth ſhew this corruption of our nature, that the Spirit, that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy. And where the verſe is cited, you may miſſe of that edification which you may attain, unleſſe you mark the ſcope, for the holy Spirit doth in divers verſes drive to one chief Concluſion, therefore you muſt conſider many verſes, and it may be the whole chapter, before you find the true ſenſe of a verſe.</p>
               <p>I will not excuſe my want herein, in not citing every verſe, But beloved, all my labour is to gain this of you, to delight in all the Bleſſed Book of God. And if this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be attained, I ſhall think my labour well beſtowed: and out of this deſire, I hope, it may come to paſſe, I may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to do you further ſervice.</p>

Beloved Reader, concerning this Text and the threatning in it to the terror of the ſerpent and his ſeed, be pleaſed to read Mr. <hi>Pynchons</hi> booke of the meritorious price of mans redemption, printed 1655. there you will have plentifull ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but for this little worke I purpoſe cheifly to enlarge my ſelfe, not as it is a threatning, but as it is a promiſe concerning Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. From this firſt preaching of Chriſt till the myſtery of God, which he hath ſpoken by his holy Prophets and Apoſtles be finiſhed, wee muſt mind this conſtantly, that Gods purpoſe was not to bring man fallen, to life by the remains of any naturall abilities; there was a Bar that wee ſhould not think of any hope in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> But by a new and living way in the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> This is a Covenant of Grace, not to him that worketh, but to him that beleeveth and receiveth the Son of God as Mediator, him hath God exalted (in holy doctrine from the begining) with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give change of mind and forgiveneſſe of ſins to all the Iſrael of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 31. Now this new way is very fooliſhneſſe to us naturally, therefore wee dream of great excellencies in our corrupt, dead, ſtinking graves: But we muſt hear the voice of the Son of God in his owne ordinances, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. and he muſt ſay to us, live, afore we can have the firſt Reſurrection, as we cannot have the ſecond without his powerfull voice, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

Neither <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> nor any of his poſterity had ſuch abilities, and for any thing they could do, they ſhould have born their own iniquities, which was ſuch a yoke, that neither Patriarch nor Apoſtle were able to bear; change of mind and forgiveneſſe of ſins was ever preached to be by the ſecond <hi>Adam, Luke</hi> 24.47. Be it knowne therefore to all men (ſaith this firſt promiſe) that through this bleſſed ſeed, the ſon of God made man is preached to us the forgiveneſſe of ſins, and by him all that beleeve are juſtified (that is, made free) from the guilt of ſin and puniſhment, from which we could not be juſtified or made free by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 13.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. Jehovah made it a ſeal of his promiſe, and covenant of bleſſedneſſe in Chriſt, to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. Therefore it was a ſeal of Gods Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtification, and adoption, and God did thus keepe his covenant with them.</p>
                  <p>Of Gods reconciliation, becauſe God all ſufficient doth condeſcend to enter into covenant with ſinfull man.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59152:39"/>
                  <p>Of Juſtification or remiſſion of ſins becauſe it is a ſeale of the juſtification that is by faith, God did juſtifie the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by faith, and all the policy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, or ſhould have profeſſed the ſame; God gave it for that ſame end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>Of Adoption, becauſe God ſelected <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, and preferred them above all Nations to be a choſen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a royall Preiſt-hood, an holy nation, a purchaſed and peculiar people. And therefore alſo God had ſayd to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Iſrael <hi>is my firſt borne,</hi> Exod. 4. and 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is ſignified and ſealed to them, to fathers and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant children, their reconciliation with God by putting off the ſinfull body of the fleſh, in which they were conceived; and by conſequent the putting on the new man: So mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſanctification, or regeneration is taught. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ever drew them to the ſpirituall meaning, and to reſt in the outward worke. and the faithfull did thus keep their covenant with God. The Saints made excellent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this ſeal of faith for inſtruction and conſolation of their owne ſoules, as of their poſterity, as <hi>Moſes, Manoah, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, David, Eſaias,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6. <hi>and</hi> 17.36. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. And obſerve the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> what he ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Col</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It ſealed to them both to Fathers and their infant chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the bleſſed Eſtate of the immortality of the ſoule, and the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. It was a ſeale of entrance into the Church and policy of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which is called the kingdome of God, to diſtinguiſh from the Apoſtate families. For all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were by ſpeciall priviledge federally holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13, 14 <hi>Matth</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. It was a ſeal to the deed of gift of the Land of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> (the Land of Reſt or promiſe) to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his naturall ſeed and proſelytes: And of all outward neceſſary comforts for this life, both of proviſion and protection.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It ſealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould be a Father, not of the Jewes only, but of many nations, that when that deed of gift, the Prerogative of it was out, the Gentiles ſhould
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59152:39"/>be called to the faith, fathers and children to be made diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſo become <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſee, and the kingdome of God. This is ſo expounded in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. and 28.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 3. and 11.17. and 15.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Thus we may ſee what a Catechiſm out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and out of the ſeal of Circumciſion the holy Prophet <hi>Abraham</hi> might teach his houſhold, as he did, and as God teſtifies he would. Now out of all this, let this be noted, that the promiſe concerning Chriſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not onely of temporal bleſſings to him and his poſterity, but alſo of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: and that chiefly. And Circumciſion ſealed the ſame, and no other doctrine but what the promiſe taught.<note place="margin">Let <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. be throughly ſtudied of us.</note> They are vain talkers and deceivers of mindes that teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

                  <p>N. 10. <hi>In the ſteps of the faith of our Father Abraham</hi>] There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that do not walk in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> that ſaith, infants of believing parents are not in the covenant of God in Chriſt, and ſo ought not to have the ſeal conferred on them; therefore they do not adminiſter the ſeal, but ſcoff at it, as <hi>Patience</hi> did in New <hi>England.</hi> Now ſee <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, He did not only believe that the children that came of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the covenant of God in Chriſt, but he believed the ſame touching the infants of the Gentiles: therefore in teſtimony of his faith he circumciſed his houſe, the ſame day the covenant and promiſe was renewed to him, <hi>Gen</hi> 17. And all the tribes to our Lords dayes did obſerve circumciſion. And the promiſe is ſure to all the ſeed of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> is a Father, not only to that ſeed that is circumciſed, but alſo to them of the Gentiles that are uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; for he is ſaid to be the Father of us all, according to that which was ſpoken to him. That <hi>he ſhould be the father of many nations.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> is far from walking in the ſteps of the faith of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and they run into ſad uncomfortable errours: Firſt, They deny God to be the God of infants, having no right nor portion in the covenant. Secondly, If infants be not in the covenant of God in Chriſt, they ſhal not be partakers of the better reſurrection: O ye parents conſider it. Thirdly, They will not preſent them to Chriſt in his ordinances, that he ſhould teach them: what is this? but a dedication of their infants to <hi>Moloch,</hi> to the divel to be devoured. Whereas the godly parent hath great comfort that if the children of Idolatrous parents were born to God, (God ſo accounts in reſpect of his covenant) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20. how much more have godly parents comfort that their children are born to God. Let the Apoſtles reaſoning <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17. to the end of the chapter be throughly minded, and let Gods people obſerve providences, whether many of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts do not turn to Sadduciſm, denying the reſurrection, or as vile opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: for it hath been obſerved, not without cauſe, that Anabaptiſtry
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59152:43"/>is a cloke of all filthineſs, and our times have found it to be ſo. Surely they that are of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall be bleſſed with faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt: from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Mar 8. Luke 13. Rom. 4 13. <hi>and ſo they became the Iſrael of God,</hi> Gal. 6.16. The promiſe of bleſſedneſs in Chriſt is in extent as large to all converted Gentiles, and to their ſeed, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p>N. 11. <hi>The doctrine of Juſtification by faith</hi>] <hi>Abraham</hi> believeth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly: who counted his believing for his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before he received circumciſion that he might be the Father of the believing uncircumciſed Gentiles: ſo it is not hereſie, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Phariſee then, and the baptized Papiſt now would bear the world in hand. What, the Goſpel not before Popery? mark here two ſayings, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before the Goſpel to</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying, In thee ſhall all the Gentiles be bleſſed.</hi> And from this promiſe he had the juſtification that it by faith, and before circumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. The other text is <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>For unto us the Goſpel hath been preached as alſo unto them:</hi> that is to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.

For although by faith in Chriſt the ſaints were juſtified, or freed from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, inheriting the juſtification that is by faith, yet there was corruption in them iſſuing from that original or birth-ſin, that we ſtill are yoked with all: we are in Chriſt Jeſus juſtified from the reign of this ſin, but not from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in us. Gods counſel is ſuch to make us humble. This the ſaints of old felt and acknowledged, and bewayled, and prayer for further mortification, Pſalm 51. And thoſe Scriptures from two Apoſtles that were both circumciſed and baptized ſhew the truth of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. Phil. 3.12, 13. Therefore every godly ſoul muſt obſerve three things; 1. That we ſlight not any ſin in thought, word, or deed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. &amp; 7. And 2. to be careful that we content not our ſelves with bodily exercciſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.

While we are in this vale of tears, this muſt ever be in our hearts, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, and truth is not in us, but if we acknowledge our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> and to cleanſe us from all our unrighteouſneſs, and minde that of the Apoſtle. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.

                  <p>N. III. of the 4 <hi>Queſt. their infant-children,</hi> &amp;] Let us conſider two or three words more of that which is ſaid touching the infants of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that departed this life. It is Gods promiſe and covenant that are workfull, and his <hi>Spirit</hi> did bleſſe circumciſion for the joy and comfort of parents for their infants reconciliation, juſtification, ſanctification, and adoption and hope of immortal glory. The ſame covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth belong to the Parents of the Churches of the Gentiles for their infants in the ſeal of Baptiſm. Is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the holy Trinity the God of the Jewes onely; and not of the Gentiles alſo? yea of the Gentiles alſo. Thy Makers are thy Husbands, Eſay 54. faithful is he that hath promiſed, and he will do it. Therefore he is reconciled to our infants, and will juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and adopt them and bring them to immortal glory. They by circumciſion were circumciſed into one body, as is evident in all the Church politic of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo by baptiſm we are all baptized into one body, whether Iews or Greeks. The promiſe and covenant is ours as well as theirs, (as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> upon Gen. 12.2, 3. ſheweth) and baptiſm ſealeth the ſame: and the Covenant and ſeal is in extent (excepting the obligation of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and ſome judicials) as large for application to all converted Gentiles to them and to their ſeed, as of old to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their ſeed. The falſe teachers of theſe dayes ſay the Covenant with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was carnal and fleſhly, &amp;c. but this is not ſo: not ſo in Gods intent when he gave thoſe promiſes, and made that covenant, and ordeined that ſeal of his covenant: not ſo, in the judgement of the faithful, and in their whole converſation which was heavenly, as all <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.55, 72, 73, 74. Again not ſo, for after they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they did not reject <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor city, nor Temple (but in apoſtaſie) nor ſacrifices, nor waſhings, &amp;c. as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. yet God plagued them, which was for deſpiſing Chriſt in thoſe ordinances: ſo their table was made a ſnare to them: and Chriſt was a ſtumbling Stone to them, as he was to Kain. That which was ordained for their welfare, they made their ruin. And ſo if we do no more but outward exerciſes in a ſhew of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deny the power thereof, and live wickedly as they did <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. <hi>Ieremy</hi> 7.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59152:46"/>muſt know theirs and ours is the ſame Covenant (as often ſaid) onely new for Adminiſtration in fulfilling all promiſes and prophecies. Let us confer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.45. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.15. with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.3.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>with</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.2, 3. and chap. 3. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17, &amp;c. This muſt be often ſpoken and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, for we are dull of hearing. Again, better promiſes, hath reſpect to <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40 and 95. in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. Chriſt promiſeth that he will circumciſe their heart, and the heart of their ſeed, to love him, <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> their God, and to keep his commandments, &amp;c. This Chriſt ſpake to them, that they might not be deceived to think that their ſalvation ſtood in outward obſervances; as in circumciſion, &amp;c. but in ſerving God in their ſpirits in the Goſpel of his <hi>Son.</hi> And ſo this to be underſtood in all <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies. The bloud of Oxen and Goats and Rams did not, could not purge their conſcience from dead works, but their conſcience would ſtill be to them, for all their bodily exerciſe, an ill, accuſing and condemning conſcience. Their ſalvation was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, and a better hope, That Chriſt by his own moſt perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and bloud-ſhedding ſhould be a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God for us, and procure eternal redemption. And while we, as ſtrangers, converſe in this world, he would be mortification, and ſanctification, by his word and ſpirit, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. <hi>John</hi> 3. Yet let the godly take heed they neglect not ordinances, and outward obſervances of Chriſts inſtitution, though they be as the bark and ſhell, yet they are ſuch a bark and ſhell, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cannot have life kept within him without them: as a tree will not live without his bark, nor the kernel proſper without his ſhell. Publique adminiſtrations and family ordinances, and ſecret duties, are of that conſequence, that he that careleſsly neglecteth them is in danger of gangrenating errours both in doctrine and manners.</p>
                  <p>N. VI. <hi>Not of the Jews only, but of many Nations</hi>] <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.5. It is promiſed by the Lord <hi>Iehovah</hi> the performer of his promiſes. <hi>For a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many nations have I made thee:</hi> This ſpeech was ſpoken at that time when God renewed his promiſe and covenant in Chriſt with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and added the ſeal to that covenant teaching thereby that he would not be, the God of Iſrael only, but in due time the God of the Gentiles alſo; therefore the Covenant is to the infants of the Gentiles, as of the Iewes: and all faithful are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and the Iſrael of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 &amp; 6.16. and if the covenant be to the infants, then the ſeal: none dare deny it, but thoſe that care not for the education of their children in godlineſs and honeſty, for the hope of the reſurrection unto eternal life. <hi>Abraham</hi> durſt not deny the ſeal, but with all joy went about it. Again, conſider <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13. little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are comprehended in the Covenant, <hi>For of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Yea, obſerve further, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> that is, of the Church of God, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The Kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation that ſhall bring forth the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59152:46"/>So then Iſraels infants were of the kingdome of God, and ſo are the Gentiles infants. Did the Kingdom of God conſiſt of the parents and infants of Iſrael in the old Teſtament? ſurely then godly parents and their infants of the Gentiles are in equal honor. He that ſhall hill an infant ſhall be put to death as juſtly as if he had killed a parent. So the murderous, accurſed, doctrine of Anabaptiſts that would murder chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is as wicked as to kill a godly parent. For the Lord God doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and waſh infants from their ſins in his Covenant, and bring them to glory, as well as their godly parents. And again, ſeriouſly minde, The covenant of God in Chriſt by circumciſion was in full force to the death of our Lord and Saviour, Luke 1.59. and Circumciſion was a ſeal of the covenant of grace to the infants of the faithful, and infants were in covenant as is evident: and now after our Lords death were they not in covenant? Did our Lords death diſannul the Covenant of his grace in reſpect of them? <hi>abſit, abſit.</hi> It was about ſix or ſeven weeks from our Lords death to <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And the holy Apoſtle in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of his Sermon doth exhort his auditors to receive the ordinance of Baptiſm in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of ſins: and to ſhew he ſpake by the ſame Spirit of God that gave the promiſes, doth affirm that the promiſe and covenant is as firm to infants as ever it was, and therefore ſaith, <hi>The promiſe is made unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhal call, Acts</hi> 2.39.

Therefore the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, that the offence of ſin might abound to our feeling, and that we might be loathſome to our ſelves. And it muſt be noted that the Law was not declared to Iſrael only, though chiefly to them, but to the mixt multitude that came with Iſrael from Egypt.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That it might be a School-maſter to lead unto Chriſt, to ſeek the juſtification that is by the faith of Him. For Chriſt was the end, drift, and ſcope of the Law for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every one that beleeveth. <hi>Moſes</hi> politie ever aimed at him, for <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of Chriſt.

                  <p>N. 4 <hi>According to the Law</hi>] We moſt hence learn to undervalue our beſt abilities, and to be humbled for our exacteſt performances. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ordained ſacrifice for the ſins of their holy offerings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. And that the High Prieſt ſhould bear the iniquity of their holy things, which the children of Iſrael ſhall hallow in all their holy gifts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. And the Saints were ſenſible of this; confeſſing we are all unclean, and that all our righteouſneſs is as filthy raggs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.6. if the beſt man dare not juſtifie his actions, his actions cannot juſtifie him: the moſt regenerate doth not what he would and ſhould, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. a godly man ſees cauſe to hate ſomewhat he doth in his beſt actions. The Law of Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. is more ſpiritual than the beſt man. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſelves, we juſtifie the Law, that it is holy, juſt, and good.</p>

Then being juſtified by faith, we have peace toward God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 1. This verſe, yea all the chapter is but an inference from the former doctrine in chap 3. of juſtification, and from the Teſtimony that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> felt in themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Again, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen, it is God that juſtifieth, that ſetteth free, that forgiveth <hi>Romans</hi> 8.1. all our comfort dependeth on forgiveneſſe of ſin. When an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> offered ſacrifice, it is ſaid, his ſin ſhall be forgiven him, ſo he ſtood juſt by the grace of forgiveneſs, by faith in Chriſts ſacrifice. So the doctrine of juſtification by faith in Chriſt hath witneſſe of the Law, and the Prophets. No new doctrine, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. &amp; 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Romans</hi> 3.21, 21, &amp;c. <hi>Habel</hi> offering in faith inherited the righteouſneſs or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, that is by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſo in the Seal of the Lords Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. forgiveneſs of ſins is only ſpoken of as the foundation of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59152:61"/>all bleſſings, the moſt admired priviledge of the Saints, drawing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after it, as adoption, peace, joy, &amp;c. as non-forgiveneſs drawes wrath, and all other miſeries after it.

               <p>Thus, I ſuppoſe we, may ſee they needed no moe Prophets to foretell the exact time of Chriſts death, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a great Prophet, but he pointed with the finger, that Chriſt was come, and the chief point of his Miniſtry, was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the peoples heart for Chriſt, that in him they might be bleſſed, and ſaved from the curſe that was coming on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient: ſo old <hi>Simeon,</hi> with <hi>Zachurias</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſe did declare <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come, of whom <hi>Daniel</hi> and all the Prophets ſpake, and <hi>John-Elias,</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Iſrael, ſaying, the Kingdome of heaven is come, as <hi>Daniel</hi> had foretold, chap. 2. and 7, and 9.</p>

                  <p>With Queſtions, Anſwers, and Annotations, Concerning the two Witneſſes, and the mark of the Beaſt: And the decay of the myſtery of iniquity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>QUeſt. 1. <hi>Who kept the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and the word of God that came from Sems Tents in the times of the riſing and height of the Pontificality?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Many in the times of the riſing of it, and there were here and there two Witneſſes, ſome that followed the true Lamb, and that in the height of it, prophecyed, miſliked, and cryed out againſt the proceedings of the myſtery of iniquity. But this company were not ſo conſpicuous and viſibly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being for divers Hundreds of years driven as into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs through a red ſea of fire and fagot by the Beaſt of the Bottomleſs pit, the counterfeit Lamb, and the prevailing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his ſix hundred ſixty ſix apoſtatical number, yet at the laſt, the Brethren overcame by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
               <p>QUeſt. 2. <hi>Then the papacy would not bear with ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſts faithful witneſſes were cauſed to mourn in Sackcloath: No man might buy or ſell that would not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

That Whoriſh Church, was and is drunk with the bloud, and martyrs, of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>QUeſt. 3. <hi>What do you underſtand to be the mark of the Beaſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Popes Canon-Law telleth that none may live under the Empire, but by yielding to the Popes Lawes, in his ſubſcribing to his Imperial and Eccleſiaſticall Supremacy, and oath of fidelity as a mark on the hand, and ſome open token of communion with him, and profeſſion of his decrees as a mark in the forehead: The ſaying of the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> went over all to the poor beggars, and reverence to the croſs, and comming to their moſt wicked Maſs. Forbidding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from reading and teaching the holy Scriptures, but for licenſed and auricular Confeſſion. Briefly all differing from their Dracons Lawes were heretiques, and mightnot uſe policy having not the marks of his Politie.</p>
               <p>QUeſt. 4. <hi>Did then the Pontificalitie and Papacy (as the old Empire) porſecute the faith of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, for it is ſaid that the latter Beaſt like a Lamb with two horns, did all that the former Beaſt did. He had the voice and ſpeach of the Dracon-<hi>Caeſars:</hi> and did maintain the ſame War againſt the<note n="*" place="margin">For the wars of the dragon-<hi>Caeſars,</hi> and dragon-Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Note as the old Beaſt-like enemies fought againſt the faith of Jeruſalem Sems Tents, and the People of God: ſo <hi>Rome-Egypt, Rome-Babylon,</hi> with like cruelty and inteſtine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred both in the Caeſars, and Popes againſt the ſame glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith of Jeruſalem the holy.

As there is a like revolution of time, ſo there is of other matters of Chriſts adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>QUeſt. 5. <hi>But the myſtery of Iniquity the ſpiritual Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy did not ſtill continue in that ſtrength and repute in the Chriſtian world, as it had in former times?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle foretold that the Lord Jeſus would conſume that wicked, that man of ſin, and his corporation with the Spirit of his mouth, and aboliſh it with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his coming; ſo the fifteenth century, the Lamb, the King of mount Sion appeared with one hundred and forty four thouſand, attending on him who cauſed the Goſpel to break out again, and the light of it in the holy city increaſed to our daies that Chriſt the Sun of Iuſtice ſhineth and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>England, Scotland, France, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> Bleſſed be his glorious name.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, for the preaching of the eternal Goſpel fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Rome-babylon,</hi> and buildeth <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This the Sword of Chriſts mouth, hath conſumed the Kingdome of the Beaſt: and chiefly through this, <hi>Abaddon</hi> the ſon of perdition, the angel of the bottomleſs pit, and his curſed earthly politie and corporation ſhall be periſhing to the end, and is every day go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to utter perdition.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Q. My moſt gracious Lord and Soveraign, I have been ſome years with you, &amp; though you have often ſpoken to me to be a Proſelite to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Iſraels common-weal, yet I cannot bring my heart unto it, you well know that my education was not in the way &amp; manner of Iſrael, and my affection is not toward it, it is not ſo pleaſing to me, for I cannot forget my fathers houſe, nor forſake his Religion: In this caſe I ſhall blemiſh my father, and my mother, brethren, and ſiſters, and people, in caſe I ſhould apoſtatiſe from our ancient Religion, and in my opinion far the better, we have more zeal in ours, and many moe pleaſures to give man and woman content, than is in your profeſſion: your Religion is very croſſe to mans nature, and is urged with great terrour and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, your Religion reproves thoughts, words, and moſt mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: no Religion under heaven doth ſo as yours, and that makes ſo few to embrace it. Yea many of Iſrael have formerly been more addicted,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59152:170"/>unto ours, and the worſhips of neighbours Nations than to this of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they will not follow it but by compulſion of Governors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as religious worſhips ſhould be freely exerciſed according to every mans conſcience; when if your ſubjects ſhould be left unto, you well know which way the ride will run, it is a pitifull thing that man of a noble and free ſpirit ſhould be ſo tyred with hard injunctions, and heavy burdens, as with bands, cords, and fetters, and it may be, that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that your noble Father indeavoured, and your ſelfe have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, would not and will not be ſo convenient, as due liberty, which would be a more noble deſign than rigid reformation. And if Antiquity make things reverend, then our Religion is more ancient, or if not more, yet as equall for Antiquity, for ought I can learne (I am but a poor Hiſtorian being a woman) but I am able to prove the Religion of our God <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> to be above four hundred and fifty years old. This I can atteſt and prove by your own Records, and you had yours but in the wilderneſſe when ye came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King.</hi> Then ſaid King <hi>Salomon,</hi> what my <hi>Tirzana,</hi> doth all your ſpeach tend unto?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queen.</hi> I humbly crave your Graces favour to finiſh my ſpeach, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have heard my Father and Grand-father speake what plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, and proſperity our God <hi>Chemoſh</hi> hath given us, nay what victories we have had againſt our mighty enemies, the Giants called <hi>Emims,</hi> and as it was your God that conquered the <hi>Chanaanites</hi> for you, ſo it was our God <hi>Chemoſh</hi> that conquered the tall, great and terrible Giants, the Emims for us. Yea, which I am loath to utter, our God <hi>Chemoſh</hi> hath given our Fathers power over <hi>Iſrael</hi> for twenty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Oh, ſhould not we then have a moſt devout opinion of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But why ſhould I your hand-maid thus be bold to ſpeake to your royall and ſacred Majeſty, your great favour and reſpect unto me hath quickned my ſpirit, and then with an humble deportment of body with her face to the ground, ſhe ſaid, the intent of all my ſpeach is, that it would pleaſe my Sovereign Lord the King, to grant my ſmall requeſt, I humbly beſeech that I may have leave to build a Chappell on Mount <hi>Oliver</hi> to worſhip our famous and reverend <hi>Numen, Chemoſh</hi> the God of my Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King.</hi> What is this I heare from you my Dear? Did your ſpeach drive at this? Oh I may not doe this; <hi>Jehovah</hi> our moſt holy Lord God whom we worſhip in his holy Temple is the true everlaſting God, and he can command nothing but what is good and perfectly good, ſo that we need not add any thing, and he forbids nothing but what is evil, which we muſt not diſ-annull; and he is the Sovereign Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and it is moſt requiſite that man ſhould ſubject himſelfe to the moſt high, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and God above all Gods: and therefore all the Children of men muſt be ſubject to his Laws, and whoſoever harden himſelfe againſt him by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59152:171"/>ſhall never proſper, and whereas you talk of ſtrictneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you are to know, man by nature is borne a wild aſſe colt, and there is no c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. And whereas you talke that man is of a noble and free Spirit, you are deceived in your apprehenſions, he is of a moſt ignoble Spirit, ready to fall into all vile opinions, and to all ſin and wickedneſſe, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all tentations to evill, as for his freedome of ſpirit, he is free indeed to all evil as an horſe ruſhing into the battell, and not one ſpark of that celeſtiall fire is in him to any good till God put it in him, and maintain it when he hath ſo infuſed it. Mans mind, will, and affections, are all corrupt, and in himſelfe no healing can be found: How mercifull then was our God, that he from whom we fell would give us a holy Law to be a medicine and healing. Doctrine to reſtore the ſoul, as his mercy and goodneſſe is unſpeakable in giving us his word, for our need (which is better known to God then our ſelves) called for ſuch bleſſed Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Revelation as is declared in our moſt holy and moſt righteous Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> received of God for us. And we and all men muſt obey this Law, and be reformed by it if we will have any comfort or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in this world or hope in another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas you talke of due liberty, my beloved, <hi>Tirzena</hi> I would have thee to conſider all the reformation we can poſſibly attaine unto by the carefull induſtry of my royall authority, and of our Preiſts and Prophets, and Scholes will not come to that purity and exactneſſe, that the Lord our God requires. Many imperfections in omiſſions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions will appeare continually through the luſts of corrupted nature that war in our ſouls, by reaſon of the darkneſſe of the underſtanding, and the untractableneſſe of the will and the affections. And none that have a feeling of the moſt holy Lord God, and of his truth in the heart, but find this thus. And therefore to give the leaſt liberty to thy opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſuch a deſigne that will provoke to anger our gracious and mighty Lord God, and if I give liberty to thy opinion, why not to the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Moloch</hi> of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and to the opinion of <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taroth,</hi> the abomination of the <hi>Zidonians.</hi> And ſo in the end to root out the holy faith of the Son of God, our great high Preiſt <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi> and then that you deſire will prove an evill impetuos, to the downe fall of truth and godlineſſe, and hardly ever be reclaimable, yea,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59152:171"/>let me inforce this further, that there cannot be any liberty granted in any reſpect to falſe worſhips, and ungodly opinions, ſuch liberty will bring us and our poſterity to miſerable bondage, as our Fathers felt in the Wilderneſſe, and in the times of the Judges: And if we that now live, and our poſterity doe not keep cloſe to that reformation which is now ſetled in <hi>Iſraels</hi> Common-Weal, <hi>Jehovah</hi> our God who is a jealous God, will deſtroy this glorious Temple that we have built to his name, and ſhake this Kingdome by many greivous calamities: and at laſt weed us out of this good Land that he hath given to us and to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore you ſpeak moſt unworthily, to call our Reformation ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid. And whereas you talke of pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt know the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin are but for a time, which waſt before we can enjoy them: And all ſuch luſts and pleaſures doe but war againſt our ſouls, as for the fewneſſe of them that follow our God the Lord of Heaven and Earth, it ſhould put you to a ſtand whether the moſt doe not goe the broad way to deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

I muſt warne you of a great errour: whereas you ſay your Chemoſh conquered the Emims for your Anceſtors, no ſuch matter, it was our mercifull God that deſtroyed thoſe Giants and gave you their Land, this our mighty Lord God did, becauſe your Father <hi>Lot</hi> loved our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and did follow his faith and holy Religion, and he did bleſſe our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God <hi>bleſſed</hi> him, &amp; for this cauſe our God gave <hi>AR</hi> unto the Children of <hi>Lot</hi> for a poſſeſſion. And this you may read in our holy ſtories, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.9. And your God is a falſe God; an idol, but our <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the Eternall Lord God who made the Heavens and the Earth, and a jealous God, and will be very angry with us if I ſhould grant in his Land any more Temples to be builded then his own, And you cannot be ignorant of this, nor your own kindred, that our Eternall God is not ſuch as your

               <p>BEloved Reader, there hath been in ſome places, not a little ſtir about the ſufferings of our Lord, which doubtleſſe were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous great, even greater then can well be expreſſed: But yet unleſſe a man will ſay as ſome ſay, that he ſuffred the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſentiall Torments of Hell, they will account ſuch little better then Heretiques.</p>
               <p>The very firſt occaſion of his aſſertion, was as I conceive from the miſ-underſtanding of the holy Article of the Creed, commonly called the Apoſtles Creed, which ſpeaks thus in the originall Greek, K <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>It is noted by Mr. <hi>Bro</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Wilmos,</hi> and by ſome others alſo that <hi>Hades</hi> hath theſe three principall ſignifications.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hades</hi> doth ſignifie death to the perſon, or deſtruction to things, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. Thou <hi>Capernaum</hi> which art exalted to Heaven ſhalt be brought downe to <hi>Hades,</hi> that is to the loweſt Earth, this City was deſtroyed by the Juſtice of God, becauſe they deſpiſed the dayes of the Son of man, and did not regard his bleſſed viſitation, although he was much converſant both in preaching and working miracles among them, ſo that now there is but a little remainder of it left, as Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> excellently ſhews in <hi>P.</hi> 347. The words of Chriſt doé ſhew the once greatneſſe of that City both in temporall and ſpirituall reſpects: It was one of the principall Cities of <hi>Decapolis,</hi> and the metropolis of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and though ſome marks of this Cities magnificence were ſeen in Saint <hi>Jeroms</hi> time, it being then a reaſonable Burge or Towne, yet thoſe that have ſeen it ſince (as <hi>Brochard, Bradeinbech, and Saliniac</hi>) affirm that it conſiſted but of ſix poore Fiſhermens Houſes, and thus it hath pleaſed God by his providence to direct that Hiſtories ſhould ſhew the ſad event of Chriſts propheticall threatning, and in this ſence <hi>Sheol</hi> is alſo uſed in <hi>Num.</hi> 16.33. for the death and deſtruction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. was to prove the Reſurrection of Chriſt from death to life againſt the Saduces, he did not diſpute of the ſecond death, nor of a journey to Hell (as many underſtand Hell) nor of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hell Torments in his ſoul, as ſome doe alſo underſtand Hell in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. for if he had ſo diſputed with the Saduces.

               <p>The holy rational ſoul of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his death went to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59152:177"/>the happy part of <hi>Hades,</hi> namely to that part of it, that is called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe. The rich mans ſoul at his death went likewiſe to <hi>Hades,</hi> but yet it was to that part of it that is called <hi>Gehenna,</hi> to torments in the lake of fire. <hi>'Abrahams</hi> Boſome was in <hi>Hades,</hi> and the rich man was alſo in <hi>Hades,</hi> and there <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the rich man ſpake to each other, which ſheweth that they were in the ſame world of ſouls, though in ſeveral diſtinct lots, and it is evident by <hi>Eſ.</hi> 66. that the godly and the wicked kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All ſouls aſcend to Gods Throne, <hi>Eccl</hi> 3. and 12 yea even the wicked aſcend to Gods Throne, in the proper term of aſcending, and have their lot there before the Throne of God, and in the preſence of the juſt, and are tormented in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. theſe places ſhew that the place of joy and the place of torment are in ſight and ſome near diſtance to each other, and that <hi>Hades</hi> is the generall term of them both.

               <p>THis Phraſe, The Boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> did ariſe, and was made familiar (as I ſuppoſe) by the faithfull <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rabbins before our Lords dayes, upon this Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant of God in Chriſt was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, that in his Seed all nations ſhould be bleſſed, and thereupon ſuch as deſired to be partakers of that bleſſedneſſe, muſt be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and muſt teſtifie their deſire by receiving Circumciſion, the Seal of that Covenant, and then they were alſo received into his houſe, or into his Church, and ſo they were as it were nouriſhed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, where they were nouriſhed by Gods Ordinances, and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> was very hoſpital to all, but eſpecially to them that were of the houſhold of his faith; he received and nouriſhed ſuch, not onely with temporall, but with ſpiritual food, he taught them the way of God in Chriſt, and inſtructed them in the true meaning of his Commandements, Statutes and Laws, all which <hi>Abraham</hi> obſerved and kept, and he is commended of God therefore in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.5. and long before this, God ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> I know him, that he will command his ſons and his houſe after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, that is, the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, faith and obedience, preſcribed for men to walk in, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, 19. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 18.25, 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.6. and 10, 12. and therefore all the faithfull of his houſe might at their death expect to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with him of the heavenly City, which God had prepared for them, and therefore when they died, they might ſtill be ſaid to be in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome; for all the faithfull, whether they continue alive in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59152:180"/>this world, or depart this life in the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are called <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children, and therefore when they die their ſpirits go to Paradiſe, to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome.

               <argument>
                  <p>Some Propoſitions and Expoſtulations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true nature of Chriſts Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BEloved Reader, we are yet further preſſed, and orthodox Churches are called up as Troopers againſt us (about the true nature of Chriſts ſufferings) we acknowledge that the very remembrance of them is reverend, and doth joy us, not annoy us. I know we ſhall not fight but treat: for they may perceive that we have otthodox Churches with us, and as learned Leaders though perhaps not ſo many: That is not much materiall, for the book of God muſt lie between them and us, and they and we muſt ſearch the holy pages, that ſo by them we both may be compoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be lamented, that the Article of our Lords going to the joyes of God taught in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhould be taught people of ſuffering hell-torments, that when we ſhould be taught to underſtand <hi>Hades</hi> of heaven, we have been inſtructed to underſtand it of hell, but we hope it will be ſo no more, to put darkneſſe for light, and evil for good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But now of latter times ſome learned ſeeing the native meaning of the greek in the Article, will neither juſtifie the tranſlation, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is made upon it, and yet ſtill they do labour to make the matter good about hell-torments, and therefore they have endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Scriptures to fortifie that opinion, which how orthodoxly they have done, it is hoped men may have leave to examine, which if it be denied, then we ſhall transfer the infallibility of the Pontifician chair (juſtly decried) to them whom we know will not arrogate any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are Orthodox Churches ſo infallible in all things, may not godly learned men utter unſound Doctrines, and much miſcarry in matters of ſound judgement and application? It is poſſible they may. There were in times paſt three godly Divines, none like them now on the earth, yet
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59152:181"/>they did not ſpeak of God right things, although they thought they ſpake in the behalf of God. I will tranſcribe what is ſpoken of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hear now my reaſoning, and hearken to the pleading of my lips; will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully for him? will ye accept his perſon? will ye contend for God? Is it good he ſhould ſearch you out?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job will tell us that it is not good to defend Gods cauſe with an error, pretending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> 
                  <hi>or as one mocketh another, do you ſo mock with him? He will ſurely reprove you, if you do ſecretly reſpect perſons. Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. They were holy men, and ſpoke moſt excellently, and we ſee by this, that though they exalted Gods holy juſtice in their applications, yet they ſpake not righteouſly, as Chriſt teſtifieth for the comfort of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Job</hi> in chap. 42. Thus <hi>Job</hi> ſpake to his three friends, and we hope we ſpeak to friends, and we doubt not but they will remember that we ought not to have the faith our glorious Lord Jeſus Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And we hope our learned will ſay, as <hi>Elihu,</hi> What ſhall we ſay to him, for we cannot order our ſpeech by reaſon of darkneſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 37. and they will acknowledge they know in part, and propheſie in part, and we hope they wil not be angry, if we judge of what they ſay, the Apoſtle would not be angry, but ſaid, <hi>Judge ye what I ſay?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and we hope they will not deny, but that they may know (we will not ſay, be inſtructed in) the way of Chriſt more perfectly.</p>
               <p n="7">7. May not godly Miniſters now ſpeak things not fitting about the ſufferings of our Lord and Saviour, as if any ſhall ſay, that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> els we ſhould have ſuffered it: if any ſhall ſay, he ſuffered <hi>Hell torments</hi> for the ſame reaſon. If any ſhall ſay, that the Son of God was not Chriſt for a time, when he underwent the wrath of God. Alſo if any ſhall ſay, that in his agonie in the garden, or upon the Croſſe, he did enter the liſts to fight the great combate hand to hand with his angry Father, <hi>&amp;c.&amp;c.</hi> Are theſe ſpeeches, if any ſhall ſo ſay, the Dialect of the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> in his holy Scriptures which he hath conveyed unto us, by his infinite, good, and gracious providence?</p>
               <p>Again, if ſome good men ſhall have theſe paſſages, that it was not the violence of his crucifying, that cut off his life, but the wrath and curſe of God ſwallowed up his ſpirit, and made his heart fail him, and that his ſoul left the body in that agonie. Thus, if any ſhall ſay, then one may inter, that he felt not the love of God his Father, before, he yielded the Spirit, but died in a cloud, but we are taught of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Pſal. 22 <hi>the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of ii.</hi>
                  </note> that when the <hi>Seed of the Serpent</hi> was ſo buſie in breaking the <hi>foot ſoal,</hi> piercing the <hi>hands and feet of the * morning Star,</hi> that he with an holy peaceable, and quiet ſpirit, as a ſheep dumb before the ſhearer commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, and prayed, <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for thy know not what they do.</hi> And it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. that he did alwayes behold the Lord his heavenly Father before him,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59152:182"/>and that he was ſtill at his right hand, that he could not be ſo moved, or diſturbed in ſoul as ſome talk. The world was made to ſhew principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, and thrones, and dominions, the contrary that he would rule all his ſouls affections, in an holy and glorious manner, and by that Juſtice make a new world, and that he the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his affections more than ever the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> he had power to trouble himſelf with grief and ſorrow, and to be affected with grief and ſufferings from others, and to rejoyce as he ſaw occaſion: he could rule his affections as he did the waves of the ſea, ſo far to go, and no further, ſuch an holy Majeſty appeared in all his Sufferings at all times, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his agonie in the garden, and ſufferings on the Croſſe. In all which he carried himſelf beyond the comprehenſion of men and angels. And this doth more appear, if we conſider the ſweet, heavenly and calm conference he had with the repenting thief on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>He that bade us poſſeſſe our ſouls in patience, that ſo in all afflictions we might enjoy our ſelves, he much more did enjoy himſelf by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and obedience, and as <hi>David</hi> in type ſaith, <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he enclined his ear unto me, and ſaved him from the pit of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous aſ flictions.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus was from the fear of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.7. Again he loved his enemies, and did good to them that hated him, and prayed for them, and bade us ſo to do, and to overcome evil with goodneſſe, thus the LORD ruled his affections, and gives us grace for grace ſo to do, as <hi>Stephen, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in that agonie in the garden there was an angel from heaven, ſtrengthening and comforting the humanity, ſo that he was neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken (as ſome underſtand forſaken) of the Father, nor of the holy Angels, and if God had forſaken him, what Angel durſt come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him? That we may better underſtand the term forſaken. The rich man (we know) was forſaken of God, for he was in torments under the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> and therefore he might not have ſo much as a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool his luxurious palate, much leſſe might he have an holy Angel from heaven to comfort him: and it is moſt evident that Chriſt was not forſaken, for the holy Angel did not come from heaven to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus without a commiſſion from the heavenly Father, to whom the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity prayed, and therefore in the cloſure of his meritorious ſufferings, his heart rejoyced, and his tongue was glad, and being full of faith and comfort he ſaid, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit,</hi> and then he ſent out his Spirit from his Body.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Again, if ſome ſhall ſay, the wrath of God (as ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand wrath) killed Chriſt. We ſhould be well adviſed what paſſeth the doore of our lips; for Chriſt our holy Mediatour ſaid, <hi>I have power to lay down my life,</hi>

                  <hi>and have power to take it again</hi> This commiſſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>have I received from my Father,</hi> alſo he ſaid, <hi>As the Father knoweth me, ſo know I the Father, and lay down my life for the ſheep—therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may

               <p n="11">11. Many Miniſters have ſome expreſſions about our Lords Sufferings, which many godly, and learned Divines have teſtified are not warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for what are we duſt and aſhes to ſpeak of God and our Redeemer, and Mediatour, words not comely, but we all ſhould conſider, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. The aſſertion, that our Lord ſuffered hell-torments in this life, in his ſoul (or body) appeareth not true by any Scripture.

God the Father to fight with God the Son: Is this good Orthodox Theoligie to be ſould or taught in Pulpits, or in Books to the people of God, doubtleſſe there is a deep ſilence of ſuch expreſſions in the Book of God.

               <p n="1">1. I pray conſider it well, did the humanity of our bleſſed Saviour and Mediatour, cope or combate with the Divine nature of the God the Father? Alas! the humanity, though holy, yet it was but a finite creature created in time, and what is a finite creature to the infinite creator? The humane nature in a ſuch a caſe could not abide the leaſt touch of contradiction: But I ſuppoſe we muſt ſeriouſly conſider that the humanity did evermore from its conception ſubſiſt in the Divine

               <p n="3">3 Is it not ſtrange Doctrine to affirme that the Lord Jeſus with the helpe of a holy Angell did combate with God, for in his Agony in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. there was an Angel ſent from Heaven to ſtrengthen him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Was it ever heard that a Mediator between two at variance, ſhould fight with the ſtronger oppoſite to bring him to agreement? ſome Teachers in teaching ſuch Doctrines muſt uſe ſome ſuch like ſtrange language.</p>

                  <p>Obſervations upon that diſtinction which ſome make between the locall and penall Hell: which penall Hell ſome ſay Chriſt ſuffered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. SOme ſay that God can make a mans Hell here in this world, by which ſpeach they muſt meane (if they meane any thing to he point in diſpute) that God can ſo plague a man in this world that the will not bring him to eternall deſtruction in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna</hi> in the world to come: I grant that the eternall Lord can do what he pleaſeth both in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and in all deep places, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 135.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame eternall Lord can alſo make a Heaven for his children here in this world, and never bring them to everlaſting glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the World to come: But Teachers, muſt not bring their own ſpeculations, let them be true ſeers to ſhew us the viſions of God from his word rightly expounded, even his Revelled will, for nothing elſe belongs to us and to our children.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Scriptures tells us that there is an everlawing bleſſed eſtate for all Gods choſen not heare but in the Heavenly paradiſe, though each bleſſing is here begun by juſtification, is freedome from ſin, death, <hi>Satan;</hi> whence ariſeth peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt, the firſt fruites of the ſpirit: In like ſort there is a place appointed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, for their everlaſting torment not hear, but in Hell, in the world to come, hut yet man) times ſome of theſe Reprobates have, as it were the firſt fruites of Hell torments here, in this world, by an accuſing and tormenting conſcience, as <hi>Kain, Caligula, &amp;c.</hi> but not the eſſentiall Torments of Hell till they come into the very place of Hell it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And yet ſome have ſaid that locall Hell is but a circumſtance, and that our Lord ſuffered penall Hell, though not in local Hell: In like ſort they may as well affirme that the glorious place of Heaven in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59152:185"/>the world to come is but a circumſtance, and ſo in this ſence all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things in reſpect of God are but circumſtances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is it well done to make this diſtinction and diviſion of a penal Hell from a local Hell, our old Engliſh Saxon word. <hi>Hell,</hi> will not manage this cauſe, neither for Plaintiff nor Defendant.</p>
               <p>It is not <hi>Hades</hi> unto which our Engliſh Saxon word doth not anſwer but <hi>Gehenna,</hi> that Eccleſiaſticks muſt cleare about our Lords ſufferings for all the Saints do in one kind or other undergoe <hi>Hades</hi> in this world, and ſo our Lord did undergoe <hi>Hades</hi> in two of its ſignifications, namely firſt in the death of his humanity, and then after that death he was put in <hi>Hades</hi> the grave, and thirdly the wicked Eccleſia of he Council was a Gate of <hi>Hades</hi> to him, and ſo in like ſort all wicked Courts are Gates of <hi>Hades:</hi> to the Godly Martyrs, &amp; therefore ſuch Courts are in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. called the Gates of <hi>Hades,</hi> godly Martyrs muſt remember when they are going to ſuch Courts that they are going to the Gates of <hi>Hades,</hi> and yet they muſt incourage themſelves, and one another, with that ſpeach which Chriſt ſpake by his Spirit to the Churches in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. Fear not I have the Keyes of <hi>Hades</hi> and death, and that he ſhewed in his own Reſurrection, and will one day in ours, ſo then perſecuting Tyrants, have not power ſimply over the bodies of the godly, they could not retain <hi>Peters</hi> body in Priſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. nor the bodies of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas, Act.</hi> 16, Chriſt did not as yet grant leave to their perſecutors to turn the Keye to let them into <hi>Hades,</hi> though afterwards he did, <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>James</hi> were the firſt Martyrs of the New Teſtament that were ſent to <hi>Hades,</hi> and Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was the laſt great Martyr of the Old Teſtament whom they ſent to <hi>Hades,</hi> for the old Teſtament was not diſannulled, but by his death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a great comfort that perſecuting Tyrants can ſend the godly no further but to <hi>Hades,</hi> they cannot ſend them to <hi>Gehenna,</hi> and if our Eccleſiaſticks will Reſt hear, we will, with good will, joyne with them both our hands and heart, that Chriſt Jeſus under-went a penall <hi>Hades</hi> in this world: But I ſuppoſe they mean further matter, or elſe they mean nothing, as indeed their meaning in this diſtinction wil come to nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This then I conceive is the ſtate of the queſtion, <hi>Whether there is a penall</hi> Gehenna <hi>in this world out of locall</hi> Gehenna <hi>in the world to come:</hi> I ſay that Gods bleſſed Book doth not ſhew this, and if any ſhall yet affirme it, we muſt be bold to ſay it is but a dreame, not the Revelation of God, which evidently ſheweth that penal <hi>Gehenna</hi> is in locall <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Let theſe Scriptures be dilligently marked for the place and puniſhment of <hi>Gehenna, Mat</hi> 5.22.29.30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.43.45.47. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.5. And now compare theſe Scriptures with the caſe of our Lords ſufferings, whether any ſparke of the penall fire of <hi>Gehenna</hi> fell upon his ſoul or body? or whether that curſed worme did ever gnaw one minute of an houre on his ſpotleſſe ſoul, as ſome dread not to affirme.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Obſervations on the ſecond Death which ſome ſay Chriſt ſuffered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE Lord Jeſus did not undergoe wrath as ſome underſtand it, of the Eſſentiall wrath of God, which alſo they tearme the ſecond death, muſt not we underſtand that whatſoever is in God is God touching the holy deity; and therefore as God is love, that is eſſentiall love, ſo his wrath is eſſentiall wrath, and can we ſay that Gods eſſentiall love was ever on Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called his beloved Son or the Son of his love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Act</hi> 2 25. yea, and that God loved him to the end as he loved the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he was in that moſt lad agony, in the Garden, there was an Angel ſent from Heaven to ſtrengthen him, which doth evidence that he was not then under the ſecond death, nor under eſſentiall wrath, for
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59152:186"/>then it had been impoſſible for any Angell, or for all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſtrengthen him or ſupport him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If he had ſuffered the ſecond death which is indeed the effect of the eſſentiall wrath of God, he could not have ſaid My God my God, why doſt thou leave me, and, O my Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe, and Father forgive them, and Father into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Spirit, neither could it be ſaid that he did alwayes behold the Lord at his right hand (as a loving Father) <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and that he did abide in the love of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When did the Lord Jeſus ſuffer the ſecond death? was it before he dyed the firſt death, or after, or did he ſuffer both deaths together? if you ſay yea, then give me leave to ask who told you ſo, did the Apoſtles at the commandment of the everlaſting God? Preach that Doctrine out of the Scriptures of the Prophets for the obedience of faith? ſhew that Scripture evidence by Scripture rightly expounded, or did he ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the ſecond death after the firſt?</p>
               <p n="5">5. When and where did the Lord of glory ſuffer the ſecond death? if you propheſy to the going down of the Sun there will be no anſwer, many Miniſters will have the Lord to ſuffer the ſecond death before the firſt, or in, and with the firſt: They muſt exerciſe their wit (but there is no Divine Revelation) what to affirme, leaſt their imaginary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be loſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We muſt know and that by Divine Revelation, that as there is a firſt death, ſo there is a ſecond death, and that the ſecond death muſt be after the firſt, or elſe if we by our wit and learning will affirme the contrary, we ſhall deſtroy Gods order, but no accuteneſſe of wit or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall ever be able to doe that; what! ſhall mans ſubtill wit nullifie the order of nature, of firſt and ſecond, and the order of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſheweth that the firſt death is in this world, and the ſecond death in the world to come. The Spirit of Chriſt ſaid by <hi>Iohn,</hi> He that overcometh (namely that overcometh the will of Tyrants by ſuffering the firſt death for the truth) ſhall nor be hurt of the ſecond death. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.11.

               <p n="7">7. The primitive Churches were admoniſhed to take heed of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after Fables, and reformed Churches have as much need to look about them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. Some have not traverſed theſe pathes as they ſhould, becauſe they have been ſo long inſtituted and catechiſed in the Doctrine of Hell-Torments, and that Chriſt the holy one of God was a ſinner, yea, the vileſt of ſinners, and when they are by modeſt arguing put out of their beaten track, they run wild and utter <hi>ſeſquipedalia verba,</hi> on their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that have and do deſire that they and their Children ſhould walke with God in ſoundneſſe of judgement, and in a godly and ſober converſation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let it be further conſidered that the firſt death hath foure parts, firſt, the death of the ſoul in ſin, ſecondly the death of the body by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thirdly, the ſeperation of the ſoul from the body, fourthly, the putrifaction of the body: Firſt the death of the ſoul is thus expreſſed, dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.5. and ſo the Goſpell is ſaid to be preached to the dead in Sin, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. Secondly, the death of the body is effected by fire, water, ſickneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, the body being dead, then the ſoul departs to the world of ſouls untill the day of the Reſurrection: Fourthly, the putrification of the body is evident by conſtant experience: The firſt part of this death, namely the death of the ſoul in Sin could not betide the Lord Jeſus becauſe of his ineffable conception in the ſanctified womb: The ſecond part the Lord Jeſus under-went when he gave himſelfe a Ranſome for the many, when he was put to death as a Malefactor on the Tree; Thirdly his ſeperated ſoul went from his dead body to the world of ſouls to the happy part of <hi>Hades,</hi> to Paradiſe, to Heaven.</p>
               <p>The fourth part of this firſt death the Lord did not undergoe, his body ſaw no corruption, <hi>Act</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now as no man may ſay that Chriſt was ſpiritually dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins, ſo neither muſt they ſay that he under went the ſecond death, none ever under-went the latter that had not firſt undergone the former.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I will cite two or three godly Authors that expound the ſecond death.</p>

               <p n="2">Secondly, <hi>Trelcatius</hi> ſaith, that by ſecond death is meant Eternall death.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. ſpeaking of the parts of the ſecond death, ſaith, the ſecond degree is an abſolute ſeperation from God, but ſaith he into this ſecond degree of this death Chriſt entred not, becauſe the Lord ſaith in the midſt of his paſſion, <hi>my God my God,</hi> and ſaith he this abſolute ſeperation could not be without the diſſolution of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall union, Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> was cautelous of going too far in the point of Cariſts ſufferings, and yet it ſeems he would have the Lord to ſuffer a part of the ſecond death, and he makes that part to be in this World, and the other part in the World to come (and that he ſuffered the firſt and ſecond death together, or rather ſome part of the ſecond death be fore the firſt) is this good Divinity, is this Doctrine Orthodox.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> alſo ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. That whole Chriſt Man-God, God-man was accurſed, is not this another fearfull ſpeach, though with limitation, and ſome retractation as it were in the ſame breath, and yet all that he ſaith, doth not, nor cannot expiate the horror of the poſition.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> alſo ſaith further on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. The ſecond death is a ſeperation from Gods favor and ſpeciall love, whereby God ceaſeth to be their God: This is the ſecond death indeed: But now let any godly man, whether learned or un-learned, bethink himſelfe, whether ever this did befall the humanity of the holy one of God. This ſpeach conferred with ſome other mens, doth infer that Chriſt was not Chriſt for a time.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It is affirmed by ſome that Chriſt bore our deſerved curſe for our Redemption: But bring this generall poſition to particulars, and then they make a ſtand, as firſt of the ſpirituall death in ſin, ſecondly, touching the corruption of the body after death, and ſome are affraid to ſay that he ſuffered any part of the ſecond death.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is not mans inventions of <hi>Tantundem &amp; Equivalency</hi> (as it is urged by ſome) touching the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt that will reach and fathom theſe things: The holy Scriptures are plaine for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and conſolation, there we may ſee who hath Redeemed us, and how, and for what, and from what, and unto what: A godly man and diligent ſearcher into the Scriptures, affirmeth that he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thus, or to this ſence, to a Reverend Divine, though I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ſaith he) uſed their expreſſions that oppoſe the <hi>idem,</hi> and affirme that Chriſt only ſuffered the <hi>Tantidem,</hi> becauſe I clearly ſaw that their way of arguing was ſufficient to confute them that affirme that Chriſt for our Redemption did ſuffer the eſſentiall Torments of Hell, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (ſaith he) I do not fully approve of their way of arguing from the <hi>Tantundem</hi> (as if it were the right way of opening Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,

               <p>But the way of Chriſts ſufferings for our Redemption that I approve and follow, is this, namely that he ſuffered as a combater, from his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant combater <hi>Satan,</hi> according to Gods declaration of the combate of enmity, between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent, for God proclaimed a liberty to the Serpents ſeed to peirce him in the foot-ſtooles as a ſinfull Malefactor on the Croſſe: And therefore hence it followes, that all Chriſts outward ſufferings muſt be inflicted on him, from the enmity of his proclaimed enemy <hi>Satan.</hi> And ſecondly, hence it follows that his internal ſufferings were from the ſence of his outward, or Chriſt as he was true man, muſt be tenderly touched, and deeply affected with his evill uſage, and therefore it was Gods will and Chriſts owne covenant, that all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>When the hour of our bleſſed Redeemer was near at hand, no Huy and Cry needed, for he ſet his face to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſaid to his Diſciples, that he went to be delivered to the ſons of men, wicked ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that they would crucifie him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. He was ſent of the Father, and came of purpoſe to give his life for his ſheep: and when they came to apprehend him, he did not ſhift nor deny his name, as malefactors do, that are purſued with Huy and Cry, but he asked with a conſtant mind, <hi>whom ſeek ye? They ſaid, Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> then he ſaid, <hi>I am he,</hi> with which ſpeech there went ſuch an energie, that they fell in a ſwound to the ground, and there might have lain, unleſſe he had given them leave to riſe out of their ſwound: Then again he asked them, whom ſeek ye? and offered himſelf willingly. <hi>Pilate</hi> with his Romans and Jews could not have had power over him, but by diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from above, that is, of Chriſt himſelf, with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, for the Lord Jeſus had ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thinkeſt thou, that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more than twelve legions of Angels,</hi> Mat. 26. Thus far of the idle expreſſion of Huy and Cry, of which there can be no defenſe.</p>

                  <p>A fourth expreſſion of the holy Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie from the Creation to the Redemption.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE golden chain of times are evident, which draw from the apoſtaſy of our firſt Parents unto our Lords Reſurrection which when they are all known do bring unto Chriſt, and we ſhall find much comfort and edification, if we often think upon them for they are a greater ornament to the Scriptures, than any chains of the fineſt gold or of the moſt rare or poliſhed Jewels to the neck.</p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:59152:200"/>
               <p>The firſt is from the beginning of time, ſince Satans fierie tongue did ſet the wheel of the whole Creation on flame, that nothing but the flood of waters (nor that) could quench it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is from the Flood to the death of <hi>Terah, Arahams</hi> father, the authour of idolatry in Chriſt his Line, and thereby cauſing to ceaſe the royall accompting of the Churches annals, by the ages of the Fathers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>The next beginneth upon his death, with a new promiſe of CHRIST making <hi>Abraham</hi> heir of the world, not through the Juſtification of the Law of Circumciſion, but through the juſtification of faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of bleſſedneſſe in Chriſt to the Families <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. This Chain draweth along to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that is the Law of the Paſſeover, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The fourth chain is from the Lamb to the Temple, the allurement of the Nations unto the worſhip of him that made the Temples of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,<note place="margin">From the lamb to the Temple, <hi>480.</hi> Salomons <hi>37.</hi> and year of diviſion, all <hi>518.</hi>
                  </note> who in fullneſſe of time would come to make humane nature his Temple to dwell with the children of men. And further this chain teacheth to <hi>Salomons</hi> death: his idolatry (as <hi>Terah</hi>) was worthy to have this chain ended, for which his Kingdome was parted, and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did ſet up calves for God, which doing, is called the ſinne of Iſrael. Theſe ſummes with the year of the Diviſion of the ten Tribes from <hi>Iudah</hi> are years 518.</p>
               <p>The fifth chain is from that apoſtaſie of Iſrael to the burning of the Temple, that ſpace is 390 years. <hi>Iudah</hi> now is onely Gods Kingdome. In that time is contained the books of the Kings,<note place="margin">Ezek. 4.</note> and 2 Chron, and moſt of the Prophets, as the table before will ſhew.

All <hi>Moſes,</hi> curtains <hi>Babel</hi> carried away for a ſpoil, and all that <hi>Hyram</hi> the King and Proſelyte procured, and <hi>Hyram</hi> the artificer made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe goodly things, left the Temple and ſhewed Chriſt his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſt by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> ſhook his own ceremonies by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ended them by <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, the meaning of that ſpeech in <hi>Aggei, Yet once more I will ſhake,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have any ſetting: yet ſome in their writings will re-edifie the low <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. But as Iſrael had a firſt and ſecond Temple: ſo <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was twice builded by <hi>David, Salomon</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and twice razed: now no other <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ever ſhall be, but that which is from heaven, and no materiall Temple ever ſhall be, for the Lord God of Hoſts, even the Lamb, is the Temple in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </note> Thus in part he did ſhake theſe ſimilitudes of heavenly things: that they might look to the ſure mercies and holy things promiſed in CHRIST unto <hi>David, Acts</hi> 13.34.</p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:59152:200"/>
               <p>The ſixth ſheweth the earthly glory of this worlds Monarks, with their abaſement and ſudden deſtruction: all this is ſeen in the golden head, <hi>Babels</hi> Kingdome, which Chriſt made as chaffe before the wind. Now the Jews had ſeen the end of <hi>Salomons</hi> progeny, the fall of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, their hope, the burning of the Temple their glory, and the fall of <hi>Babel,</hi> the glory of Nations, by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius, Salomon</hi> foreſaw all this, and ſaid, all is vanity, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is from <hi>Cyrus</hi> Proclamation of bringing back the people of God from <hi>Babels</hi> yoke to the eternall freedome the Lord Jeſus Chriſt purchaſed. This time is the glorious and ſhining Prophecy of the Seventy Sevens, <hi>Dan</hi> 9. This chain began with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> of <hi>Japhet,</hi> both which Princes proclaimed the God of heaven, the God of Iſrael over an hundred and twenty Nations, who gave Iſrael a liberall ſubſidie to comfort them in returning to <hi>Sion,</hi> who by that faith in that joyfull Prophecy left great <hi>Babel</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> yet in her duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. And this year the faith of Gods elect, ſtopped the mouth of Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this chain endeth moſt comfortably by the death of Meſſias, the Holy of Holy: which endeth all Sacrrifice and offering in the low <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and it endeth the peculiar. Prerogative of Iſrael, and it bringeth the Gentiles into equall covenant, and breaketh down the Partition wall, and blotteth out the hand writing of Ordinances, and maketh the ſhadows flee away, and with commandement of ſhewing the Kingdome of heaven to all Nations, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the SUNS labours have glorious ſtories through all ages, till Chriſt ſhewed a new world, and a new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from heaven by the preaching of the holy diſciples, who went forth by the Lords Coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and turned the familes of <hi>Noe</hi> from darkneſſe to light, from the power of Satan to God, that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>From theſe various expreſſions of the holy Chronologic, we may ſee the marks which the holy Spirit aims at in the ages and generations of the Bible. Theſe are the joints to which the holy Chronicle is faſtened, fit for Chriſtians to know concerning the Son of God, that was to come into the world, to be a <hi>Second Adam,</hi> That by theſe, as a part of the holy revelation of the Spirit of God, we might be made wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith which in is Chriſt Ieſus; For the Teſtimony of IESUS is the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
               <p>It would be wiſhed, that people were ſomewhat educated in that courſe of ſtudy, of a book called the <hi>Conſent of Scripture:</hi> That ſtudy I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe would more ſtabliſh us in ſound principles of Chriſtian Doctrine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light and vain errours, and bad opinions, then many books of ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE books of Chronicles reach from <hi>Adams</hi> to <hi>Babels</hi> captivity, and to <hi>Cyrus</hi> firſt, thence <hi>Daniel</hi> reacheth to our Lords death, and the fall of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thence the Apocalyps holdeth on to the fall of the world: the confuſion of this narration is a curſed piece of work.</p>
               <p>Seven times <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> ſeven times of the <hi>Medo-Perſians,</hi> ſeven times of <hi>Javan</hi> whole, ſeven times of <hi>Iavan</hi> parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> comforteth the holy Iews, and no other Nation afflicted for Religion by the Kings of the Eaſt, and before the incarnation, ſhewing, that as every one of his predictions ſhall fall out in their times, and they of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in exact foretold number of dayes, ſo the exact num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dayes ſhould be moſt ſurely kept for our Redemption, and the three years and half for our Lords preaching, when he muſt begin, even when he began to be thirty, and at the firſt of thoſe 30. open records of <hi>Kittim Italies</hi> power, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. ſhould ſhew that the image <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. was broken in pieces.</p>
               <p>Now the Holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament keepeth <hi>Daniel</hi> clear, that the captivity to <hi>Babel</hi> began with his captivity, that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Iechonias</hi> was begotten a little before the captivity to <hi>Babel,</hi> at the ſecond captivity he was 18. years old.</p>
               <p>So where the image is made chaffe, and the tree cut, but not at the root, and the Beaſts caſt into the fire, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> from matters paſt doth teach the Iews how they rejecting MESSIAS. Chriſt ſhall be uſed, the ax ſhall be put to the root of the tree, and the chaffe ſhall be burnt in fire unquenched. Upon ſtories paſt this ſtandeth plain, if <hi>Daniels</hi> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had been yet to come, the grace of the ſpeech had been loſt, but <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of puniſhments foretold and felt, pierceth more the wiſe hearer, that the Iews ſhall feel what he foretold.</p>
               <p>So where after the four Beaſts are conſumed, One like unto the SON of Man, cometh into the world, and again aſcendeth our great God and Saviour, naming himſelf the SON of Man and Rock, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. upon which the Iews ſtood in the boiſterous ſea, whence the four beaſts came forth, teacheth us, that thoſe four Beaſts were conſumed, ſpeaking to the whole conſent of the Jews.</p>
               <p>So Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> pleading upon the Angel <hi>Gabriels</hi> words, and having the Angels face, ſheweth, that the whole Nation agreed in time, from the return from captivity, or beginning of the Seventy Sevens, as they could not chooſe.</p>
               <p>And whereas the acts of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the vile, are much in <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 7. and 8. and 12. and concluded in chap. 11. with mention of reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to glory for his afflicted, the <hi>Macchabees</hi> company, and of reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſhame for Gods enemies, as the Iews in the third of <hi>Macchabees,</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:59152:201"/>and in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> note well, and as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> noted from them, ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before all noted the ſame, ſpeaking of tormented in <hi>Antiochus</hi> manner, that they would not be delivered, becauſe they looked for the better reſurrection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Moreover while the affliction of the Iews, were in viſions that deſcribed not their Nation plainly, that they were the tendered of God, and ſo they were without danger, they were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Chaldee, ſpread over the Eaſt, out when the ſpeeches plainly name the afflicters, and the Iews the afflicted, then they are written in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> tongue, loſt, but in Schools, and not ſpoken in the world. And this ſheweth, that the Iews are the onely afflicted in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that he hath not one ſyllable of the Romanes afflicting the Iews before the Birth of our Lord, nor one word to bring them within his pictures.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> plainly diſtinguiſheth them from <hi>Daniels</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, a <hi>Woman,</hi> that is a State ſettled, and a Beaſt coming out of the Sea, made of all the four, that are in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> is a Bridge from the Chronicles to the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and the breaker of this bridge cuteth off all paſſage from the old Teſtament to the new, and worketh a <hi>Babylonian</hi> confuſion, miſſing in the Nations, Countries, or Times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> pictureth Eaſt Kingdomes onely, he maketh ſtories agree to the proportion of a mans image, head, arms and breaſt, belly and ſides, and two legs, our notes would make but one leg, and ſix times longer than the proportion of a mans body would ſuffer. <hi>Daniel</hi> bringeth an Angel to comment upon his Viſions, applying them to ſtories which Greeks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. But none can apply our notes to fit ſtories.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> An Advertiſement to the Reader, to take heed of embracing the evil tenents of two men eſpecially, that have lately put forth irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions about the Chronology of the Book of God, namely Mr. <hi>Sarſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> they deny the certainty of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie from the firſt promiſe, to the death of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS for Mr. <hi>Sarſon,</hi> let him take heed he be not degenerated into a Sarraſon, by bringing upon the holy Bible a Leproſie of Chronologic, that it ſhould be of no greater authority, than <hi>Machomer's</hi> Alcoran.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith, there is not truth nor certainty in the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriels</hi> Seventy Sevens, when they ſhould begin or end, his words in his book of the Viſions, and Propheſies of <hi>Daniel page</hi> 51 are theſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Broughton and his followers, denying the truth of heathen Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, conſtitute the years without ground, D.R. on the other ſide, (and that worthily), allowing and maintaing the heathen Chronologie, and finding no way how to accommodate thoſe years untoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, affirmeth that no certain time is meant, but an uncertain, and undetermined duration in alluſion to the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of the</hi> Babylonian <hi>captivity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſay, there is not truth nor certainty in the holy Chronologie of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us take ſuch heed that they deny not the truth and certainty of other doctrines of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be truly ſaid, becauſe men have not loved the truth by a diligent ſearch of the holy Bibles Chronologie, they have been given up
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59152:202"/>to believe the lies of heathen Chronologies, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Chronologie of the Book of God is a doctrine of faith, as clear and certain as any other doctrine of faith, and therefore that ſpeech of the holy Apoſtle beareth ſupremacie in our hearts: That the holy Book of God doth not onely teach and inſtruct us of the truth of its Chronologie, but it doth alſo correct and convince the heathens Chronologie to be moſt falſe and abominable doctrines, as ſome produce them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is ſaid, that the holy Scripture is given by inſpiration from God, and is able to make (children yea) the man of God wiſe to ſalvation through the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus, and this muſt be underſtood of, Scripture Chronologie, as well as of any other doctrine of the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he that will rightly conſider the holy Chronologie, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſſed by ſundry calculations, will ſay, that the holy Scripture Chronologie teacheth doctrine of faith, which is in Chriſt IESUS, and (in him) by it wiſdome to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is ſaid, we have a more ſure word, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and that was the old Teſtament) but now heathen Chronologie of the deviliſh worſhips of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the heathens Olympiads are by ſome made more ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain criptures, than the oracles from heaven. We have more cauſe to yield to the Locuſts that defend their <hi>Apolluon,</hi> that alledge Fathers and Councils, than to yield to men that authoriſe the vain Olympiads of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos.</hi> Therefore let us that are Chriſtians hearken to the words and commandements of the Apoſtle of our Lord and ſaviour. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt any man carry you for a ſpoil through Phloſophy and vain deceit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rudiments of the world, and not after CHRIST,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> it is the holy ſcriptures that have ditted up the mouths of <hi>Apolluon</hi> and his Locuſts, by the <hi>RR. Jewel, Fulk, Cartwright, Perkins, Calvin, Beza, &amp;c, &amp;c.</hi> we doubt not but the holy ſcripture ſhall do the ſame to them that plead for the gameſtry of Stanicall, Olympian reckonings.</p>
               <p>Verily all the ſcriptures ſhould as well take a check, as the wiſdome touching the time of the ſeventy ſevens, be controlled by heathen. We may as well believe the heathen ſpake true (when the Sun went back) that for <hi>Hercules</hi> birth the Sun made a longer night, but the word of Chriſt ſhews, that he that ruleth the heavens made it, and did ſhew to all the world, but ſpecially to Iſrael, that the heavens order was not ſo ſtable as Gods covenant in Chriſt: for then that miracle was to confirm the faith of the church in Chriſt promiſed, ſo the ſunne performed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the SON of righteouſneſſe: ſurely the motions of the heavens declare the works of God in the harmonious meaſure of times. Although many men be great Scholars and godly, yet ſome of them do not conſider that the ſunne did run his race for the glory of Chriſt and his word. For it is ſaid, <hi>All things were created by him, and for him the ſecond Adam.</hi> For <hi>Him,</hi> for his honour and glory, not for Satans ſports and paſtimes of the Olympiads.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:59152:203"/>
               <p n="6">6. What a groſſeneſſe and croſſe is this? becauſe we cannot make the heathens accounts to agree with the holy Scripture-Chronologie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fly upon the word of the living GOD, the Lord of hoſts our God, reproaching it, and exclaiming againſt it, that there is not truth nor certainty in many parts of it, but we ſhould ſay and do the contrary: and ſhould ſay, let God and his word be true, and the heathens and their Chronicles, lies, and liars. For there is more to be ſaid.</p>
               <p>¶ If that the Angel taught not <hi>Daniel</hi> certainty of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for the Chronologie, he taught him nothing that he knew not. <hi>Daniel</hi> knew all the reſt of the Meſſage, but the time of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And ſo we make the holy Angel a deceiver, an evil ſpirit, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And therefore <hi>D.R.</hi> and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and all that follow their courſe, have ſorrily dealt with the Church of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> and his followers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>P.</hi> know, that Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> and thoſe that uſe his godly and learned labours do adhere to, and follow the lively oracles of the living God, ſent from him by an Angel from heaven, to teach <hi>Daniel</hi> knowledge and underſtanding, and to teach all faithfull Chriſtians by him. And therefore we are confident in the Lord, and dare not otherwiſe ſay, but that the holy Angel from God <hi>ſtake a true plain, and proper ſpeech, and a moſt certain chronologie for the beginning and ending of the ſeventy ſevens,</hi> and that their beginning was from <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, and their ending at the aboliſhing of ſacrifice and offering, and confirmation of the Teſtament for the <hi>Many,</hi> by the blood and death of the MESSIAS.</p>
               <p>It is true, many have objected againſt the holy Scriptures Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie before Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sarſon</hi> (which is to be lamented) but we know there are many graceleſſe ſpeeches and objections againſt the very fundamental truths of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But this I think, 1. That it is good that the Scriptures chronologie ſhould be clear and certain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.</note> and can we think that God hath omitted this good for his church?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men ſhould deem, or ought ſo to do, that the Scripture hath truth and certainty for chronologie, though they ſee it not, and they that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould think and ſay, they erre not knowing the Scriptures, and they ſhould think that the works of God, the rock are perfect, and that he that began the chronologie for the glory of Chriſt by the genealogie of his holy anceſtours, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. and 11. would perfect it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To affirm truth and certainty in Heathen chronologie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it in the holy Scriptures, is an opinion ſcelerate and flagitious: we cannot think how great the evil is: and therefore Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath done ill in juſtifying <hi>D.R.</hi> ſaying the holy Angel in his heavenly Oration to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> meant no certain time, whereas the Angel taught him perfect wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the chronologie of it, and ſo profeſſeth that he came to give ſkill of underſtanding that very thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas Mr. P. ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> denying the truth of heathen
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59152:203"/>chronologie, conſtituted the year of the ſeventy Sevens, without grounds Mr. <hi>P.</hi> in this ſaying, puts a ſtumbling block before the blind, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to go out of the way, and falls into a great offence of untruth, not onely againſt Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> (for thats little) but againſt the Angel from heaven, who ſaid to <hi>Daniel,</hi> at the beginning of <hi>thy prayer came forth the word, which I am come to tell thee, becauſe thou art greatly beloved, therefore conceive the word, and perceive the clear viſion.</hi> Which is, <hi>ſeventy Sevens of years are accounted for thy people, and for thy holy City, to finiſh treſpaſse (offerings) and to end ſin (ofierings) and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring righteouſneſſe everlaſting, and to ſeal viſion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and to ſhew Chriſt the holy of holy,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we ſee the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> is a Rock as firm and ſtable as Mount-<hi>Sion,</hi> (that we might build on Chriſt the Rock) ſpoken by an Angel. So the Angel ſpeaking from heaven, makes the begininng of the ſeventy Sevens to be from <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer, and their ending to be at the glorious manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of MESIAS, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt, to be the <hi>Holy ef Holy,</hi> which was ſeen in his healthy paſſion, and glorious Reſurrection</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us further conſider the ſpeech of the Angel, which I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and think it worth the noting again, who ſaith to <hi>Dantel, Conceive the word, and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ceive the clear viſion.</hi> By this commandement doubled for more vehement charge, he condemneth the world, that regard not to be inſtructed in this Doctrine ſent from heaven by an Augel unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and penned for all Nations uſe. Wherefore We muſt give better heed unto that ſpeech, leſt we wilfulyſwerve, for if the word ſpoken by Angels fall our ſure, and every treſpaſſe received juſt recompence, How ſhall we eſcape neglecting ſo great a charge of our King unto out own ſalvation? where the viſion is ſo clear, that no doubt can be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any plain heart, that will reſt in the clearneſſe of the moſt bright meſſage by the Angel of glory, who coming to teach all the world, was to ſhine in words, as <hi>Stephen</hi> by him did in the face, when he ſpake the Angels words, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. <hi>That Jeſus of Nazaret</hi> would deftrroy the place, city and Temple, and change the Lawes which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave. To this day the blind Jews ſtand in this, that the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall continue for ever. <hi>Maymon. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>de lege, Perek.</hi> 9. Therefore God ſeeing their dullneſſe would have an Angel of light to teach them by this Prophecy 490 years, when from the year of that Meſſage unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have their end. And none of the Scribes, when <hi>Herod</hi> was affrighted, objected diſagreement for the time, which thing had been done, if any colour of diſagreement could be brought, ſo none in all the new Teſtament touched diſagreement in the time, Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> upon <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Who would think to ſay the ſveenty Sevens are a time not certain, when as the holy Angel divides them into three parts, ſeven ſevens, and ſixty two ſevens, and one ſeven, for the ſeven ſevens he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the troubles, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="7">7. Another weighty reaſon, though noted other where, That there was great need, that Gods Iſrael, and all the world ſhould have &amp; know a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive ſentence from God how long <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Temple ſhould have their Prerogative, and how long ſacrificing ſhould be there lawfull and acceptable, and when the partition-wall ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and when the Gentiles ſhould be brought into equal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and this definitive and determinate time is moſt graciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to us in the ſeventy Sevens.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Being a Caveat to beware of ſuch Satanicall ſpirits that prattle about the expectation of new Apoſtles and new Revelations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AS is ſaid, for the <hi>Chronologie</hi> and <hi>Genealogie</hi> of the the old Teſtament, that the infallible uſe of them did ceaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the new Teſtament was written, ſo we may ſay, for the other holy Doctrine of Chriſt, that we need not to regard, the vanity of wretched men, in expectation of new Apoſtles, and new
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59152:210"/>Revelations, but ſtudiouſly to cleave to what is left and ordained, to us in the holy writings of the Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As our Lord and Saviour ſaid, He that will not hear and believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, will neither hear nor believe, if one ſhould riſe from the dead: ſo truly we may ſay, he that will not hear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the holy Evangeliſts, and the holy Apoſtles writings, who wrote of the doctrine, life, death and reſurrection of Chriſt, is as far from holy faith as ever any Sadducie was; for Chriſt is riſen from the dead, and after his Reſurrection gave commandement what his Apoſtles ſhould preach unto the Nations, and we ſee what it was they taught by the four Evangeliſts, by the book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> by their Epiſtles, and by the Son of God in his <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And that we might not be deceived by the ungodly,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4s</note> to look for new Apoſtles, mark what the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly, that himſelf and <hi>Earnabas,</hi> and other Apoſtles then living, were the laſt apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore the apoſtles, ſeeing the Churches began to be troubled with falſe apoſtles, and with grievous and gangrenating errours and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and foretold of worſe and more perillous times, that men would not endure ſound, and wholeſome doctrine, but having ſore ears, ſhould after their own luſts get them an heap of Teachers, and ſhould turn their ears from the truth, and ſhould be given unto fables, therefore they gave warning, as is ſeen in all their writings, and have thus charged us from Chriſt. That we be mindfull of the words, which were ſpoken before by the holy Prophets, and of the commandement of us the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Lord and Saviour, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2: and <hi>Iudas Thaddeus</hi> ſaith thus in his Epiſtle. But beloved, remember the words which were ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God beareth nos us, hereby know we the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of errour,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The faithfull obeyed this charge and commandement for many years after the apoſtles, for the apoſtles had ſaid, what they had taught to the faithfull then living, ſhould be communicated to other faithfull for the inſtruction of others, for above an 100 years after their dayes, we have not writings of the Ancients, they kept themſelves to the holy Scriptures of the Prophets and apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And when the Ancients of the Primitive Churches began to write, much about the ſecond Century, and after, it is manifeſt they adhered to the holy Scriptures, and commended them much to the people, and ſome of the Ancients did ſo admire and advance the holy Scriptures, that they adored the ſufficiency of them for Doctrine of faith and manners.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This is moſt clear, for it is ſaid, the faithfull martyrs for 300 years ſuffered for the <hi>Word of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> Apoc. 6.9. and ſo the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> ſuffered under the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the <hi>Pit, King Abaddon, For the keeping of the commandem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>The Expoſition of the times mentioned in in the Apocalyps.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THere is mention made in chap. 11. of 42. moneths, and 1260. dayes, thoſe ſhew the rage and cruel perſecution of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the <hi>Pit</hi> againſt the <hi>two witneſses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In chap. 12. There it is told 1260 dayes, and of a time, times and half a time: which are ſpoken of the <hi>Dragons</hi> cruelty in the <hi>Caeſars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In chap. 13. There is alſo mention made of 41 moneths, which is to be underſtood, both of the Tyranny of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the ſixth head that was wounded to death; and of the Tyranny of the Beaſt, like a Lamb that healed the wounded head of the Government of the Empire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By theſe times ſo variouſly expreſſed in divers chapters,<note place="margin">Beroald <hi>and M.</hi> Broughton</note> ancient and later Expoſitours ſhew that by them is meant <hi>the quality of State, not length of years</hi> (namely) <hi>that the Church ſhould be afflicted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Chriſt,</hi> who was perſecuted three years and half by the ſeed of the old Serpent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The like analogie is from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. and 61. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. As by the acceptable year of the Lord is meant the Iubilee year, in which Meſſias Chriſt our Lord was given for a covenant, and laid down his life for our juſtification, redemption and ending all <hi>Moſes</hi> ceremonies: But now all time of the Goſpel to the end of the world is the accepted time, and the day of ſalvation, and the acceptable year of the Lord. The like force is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That all in the Church muſt keep the feaſt of Chriſt our Paſſeover, who was ſacrificed for us with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth, to the end of all Ordinances, that is till the Son of man come to deliver up the Mediatorian Kingdome; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.</p>
               <p>The time of Tyranny under the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> was three hundred years, yet by <hi>Metonomia,</hi> meaning the argument of perſecution from our Lords time, it is called three years and half: the matter ſheweth twice in chap. 11. and twice in chap. 12. and once in chap. 13. that proper time cannot be meant: and the ſame is to be underſtood of the perſecution
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59152:212"/>of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the <hi>Pit.</hi> They who think to get any certainty from theſe numbers, deceive themſelves and their Readers. The alluſion is moſt heavenly, calling Chriſt ſtill unto mind. Our Lord preached 42 moneths or 3 years and an half, or dayes 1260, or a time, two times, and an half: ſo that theſe numbers in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> mean no certain time, but the manners from a like time is meant. The perſecuting Phariſees and Sadduces, were revived and continued by the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and Popes. The <hi>Caeſars</hi> Perſecution, as is noted, laſted 300 years, and the perſecution of the falſe <hi>Lamb</hi> laſteth yet, and will, till the Lord caſt him and his deceived into the Lake of fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeven Seals, the ſeven Trumpets, and the ſeven phials, are not diſtinguiſhed in time in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> none of theſe are, or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be referred to any exact time.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I will add a little more in briefe, of the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will give ſome light to all that may read the Hiſtories of the Church: Mr. <hi>Patrick Symſon,</hi> of the Hiſtory of the Church, will much help the Reader.</p>

This time of three hundred yeares was an age of fraudulence by Hereticks: <hi>Arius, Pelagius, Donatus, Marcion, Neſtorius, &amp;c.</hi> they were confronted by Fathers, <hi>Athanaſius, Hillary, Baſil, Nazianzen, Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The times following were alſo times of violence and fraud in Pope and Turk; Popiſh ſuperſtition ſtill increaſing exceedingly. till by the two Witneſſes it was reſiſted, by <hi>Waldenſes, Wickliff, Hus, Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Luther, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> greatly prevailed, to the removing of the Candleſticks of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as it was threatned againſt them, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. and evills in the Churches of the Eaſt prevailed by the ſtrength, deceit, and falſchood of the Papacy, till that the Turk poſſeſſed <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Empire and City.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome of Chriſt our Lord and Saviour under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was firſt impugned in the time of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and in the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the myſtery of iniquity. Then this Propheticall Office: and at laſt his Prieſtly Office was ſtriven againſt, which was almoſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately corrupted in the height of the myſtery of iniquity in the tenth

               <p>
                  <hi>From theſe Attributes ſundry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes may be gathered.</hi> 1. <hi>From the Attribute or Title</hi> Aeloim.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Aelohim</hi> is a form plurall, to teach the myſtery of the Trinity which is moſt neceſſary to be well marked; or elſe that form were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. I ſay it were dangerous, if neceſſity did not require us to be thereby taught the knowledge of the Divine perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſometimes it is joyned with a word ſingular: as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Aelohim</hi> He created, becauſe there is but one Godhead; but the plurall form of ſpeaking when it is joyned with a word ſingular, doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily call upon us to know the myſtery of the Trinity in the unity of the Godhead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This plurall Attribute <hi>Aelohim,</hi> though it be commonly joyned with a word ſingular (for the reaſon aforeſaid) yet it is ſometimes alſo joyned with a word plurall; as <hi>Aelohim,</hi> He went: 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.21. and ſo <hi>Aelohim,</hi> They went, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23. and ſo in <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.23. He is holy Gods: and in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10 10. He is living Gods; but in <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.13. it is alſo joyned with a word plurall, They Gods cauſed me to wonder: and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.7. They Gods were revealed to him.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdome of God thought theſe Expreſſions to be neceſſary for our inſtruction in the myſtery of the Trinity, and in the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or elſe it had been dangerous, for Idolatry, ſo to declare himſelfe to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn, that though ſometimes words of the plurall Number be joyned with the plurall Attribute <hi>Aelohim,</hi> yet God did no way intend thereby to teach to worſhip a plurality of Gods, as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59152:213"/>and negligent in the Scriptures are ready to underſtand it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath taken good order to cleer it from that errtour by other Scriptures, eſpecially to ſuch as are diligent in the ſtudy of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Scriptures: he hath cleered his Attribute <hi>Aelohim,</hi> from being taken for many Gods; becauſe he hath often put this Attribute into the form ſingular: as by <hi>Eloah</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 12.4. and ſometimes by a ſhorter form <hi>El,</hi> The Mighty, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. And ſecondly by joyning it often to a word ſingular; and thirdly by limiting this plurall Attribute <hi>Aelohim</hi> onely to three perſons, or Exiſtences in the unity of the Godhead: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. <hi>By the word of Jehovah the Heavens were made, and all the Hoſts of them by the ſpirit of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſaith <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1, The ancient Hebrew Doctors have left Records of this myſtery; Though at this day that Nation doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. Come and ſee (ſaith <hi>Rab. Ben Iochai</hi>) The myſtery of the word <hi>Aelohim:</hi> There are three degrees, and every degree by it ſelfe alone (that is, diſtinct) And yet notwithſtanding (ſaith he) They are all One, and are not divided one from another: And ſaith <hi>Ainſ</hi> in <hi>Numb,</hi> 15.25. <hi>Rabbi Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But (bleſſed be God) our New Teſtament doth tell us moſt cleerly.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Hence we may learn, that God is Almighty for the protection of thoſe that feare him, and that truſt in his gracious promiſes; and he is Almighty to ruinate his Churches Adverſaries: Surely there is an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohim</hi> that judgeth in the Earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Attribute, or Title, Jehovah, we may learn,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That Jehovah is the onely true God; for this Attribute ſignifies one that hath Being of himſelfe, and that gives Being to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that can take away their being at his pleaſure; and therefore it is an incommunicable Attribute, for none hath being of himſelf but he alone. 2. There is none that can give being to all other things but he alone. 3. None can take away the Being of all other things, but he
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59152:214"/>alone. But for the better underſtanding of the large ſignification of this Attribute, ſee <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Pſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. This Attribute may be a ſufficient ground of encouragement to ſuch as the Lord is pleaſed to call forth to do any difficult ſervice: as for example; when it pleaſed God to call <hi>Moſes</hi> to go on his Embaſſage to perſecuting <hi>Pharoah,</hi> he was of himſelfe unwilling becauſe of his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſpeech: But Chriſt Jeſus ſaid unto him in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.11. Who hath made the mouth of man? or who maketh the dumb, or the deaf, or the open eyed, or the blind? have not I Jehovah; therefore go now and I will be with thy mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in like ſort Chriſt ſhewed himſelf to be Jehovah, when he ſaid unto his Diſciples in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.15. I will give you a mouth and wiſdome which all your adverſaries ſhall not be able to gain ſay or reſiſt: and hence we may alſo gather, that that Jehovah which ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> was the Son of God, the Angell of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and ſo Chriſt muſt be ſtill underſtood to be called Jehovah from <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. to the end of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. After that <hi>Moſes</hi> had been diſcharged, and by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> threatning both againſt him and againſt <hi>Aaron</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. then the Lord did ſtill encourage <hi>Moſes</hi> by this Attribute in <hi>Exod</hi> 6.2. ſaying unto <hi>Moſes, I am Jehovah:</hi> as if he had ſaid in more words, be not diſcouraged, but go, for I will now in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8 give a being of performance to that promiſe which I formerly made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that I would give unto him the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This Artribute is for terrour to all perſecutors of Gods people; for Chriſt is Jehovah that gives a being to the performance of all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and of all his threatnings he told <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:59152:214"/>
               <p n="5">5. This Attribute is for inſtruction to all Gods people to take ſpeciall notice of the powerfull actings of this Jehovah for his people, and againſt their adverſaries: for as it is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.1. lehovah ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have made his heart heavy, and the heart of his ſervants, that I may ſet theſe my ſignes in the midſt of them; and that thou mayeſt tell it in the eares of thy ſon, and of thy ſons ſon,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>that yee may know that I am Iehovah.</hi> The like arguing is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the like is in <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Say unto the ſons of Iſrael, I am Iehovah: I will bring you out from under the burthens of the Egyptians.</hi> And in verſe 7. <hi>I will take you unto me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and yee ſhall know that I am Iehovah your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This Attribute is prefixed and affixed to the ten Commandements, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. for the comfort of them that are in Covenant with God, and that keep his Commandements by faith in Chriſt; and for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of ſuch as tranſgreſſe his Commandemants through the want of faith in Chriſt, for no other obedience is acceptable, but that which is mixed with faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Attribute Iehovah is often preſſed upon the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were in Covenant with God, that they may walk in holineſſe as a people in Covenant ought to do: as in <hi>Levit,</hi> 18. and in <hi>Levit,</hi> 19. and often elſwhere, as a band to tye them to yeild all holy obedince to all Gods Lawes, both to his Ceremoniall and Iudiciall Lawes, as well as to the Decalogue; and therefore obedience to all the Ceremoniall Laws is enforced on this ground: <hi>Becauſe I am Iebovah your God:</hi> and in <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.44.45. <hi>You ſhall not make your ſelves unclean by any c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Attribute</hi> Elion <hi>the moſt High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We may learn not to be daunted with the big looks of ſuch as do oppoſe us in a good Cauſe: and therefore <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> did moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently uſe this Title of God in his bleſſing to <hi>Abraham;</hi> He called him the moſt High: namely, over his Enemies the foure Kings, when he returned with Victory over them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. And then alſo <hi>Abraham</hi> told the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> in <hi>verſe</hi> 22. That he had lift up his hand unto [Iehovah, Ael, Elion] The Lord God moſt High, the Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, that he would not take any thing that was his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The like inſtruction we may learn from this Attribute in the form plurall, Elionin, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.7. Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> reads it thus: If the oppreſſion of the poor, and robery of Iudgment and Iuſtice, thou do behold in a Country, marvell not at the matter, for an higher then the high one
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59152:215"/>doth mark; and there be high above them, namely, <hi>Elionin,</hi> the high Trinity: as his Marginall Note is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ieremy</hi> in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.35.38 doth twice over complain to <hi>Elionin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked high States of <hi>Iudah,</hi> whom they felt and ſhould feele in his judgments, to be higher and mightier than they.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints of <hi>Zorobabels</hi> houſe are called the Saints of the moſt High, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.18. and they are comforted with this Attribute in <hi>Chaldy,</hi> againſt the foure perſecuting Empires there expreſſed, which ended with the parted Greek monarchy: namely, that though they ſhould by their tyraany be deprived of the poſſeſſion of an Earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet they ſhould ſtill be the Saints of <hi>(Elionin)</hi> the moſt High, and ſhall hold a Kingdome for ever, yea for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>This Chaldy term in the plurall is put for the ſingular; as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> noteth; and we may be ſure that it was ſo ſpoken to note out of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſons in the unity of the Godhead: and in this place it was fit to be plurall, becauſe it hath relation to the diſtinct viſion of the Son and of the Father; and upon the ſame account Thrones are alſo plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, in verſe 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore ſuch as are Saints muſt pay their Vowes to God moſt, high, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50, 14. as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. and the moſt High, in <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. is called Our Father which is in Heaven, in <hi>Matth</hi> 5.45.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>From the Attribute</hi> Shaddai, <hi>the Almighty or the All-ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn, that it is good for us in all our temptations to reſt or ſtay our Soules upon his promiſes; for if we be qualified with faith and grace according to his Covenant, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. we may be ſure he will be <hi>Ael Shaddai,</hi> the Almighty, or All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to performe his promiſes, and threatnings, though they ſeem never ſo unlikely to naturall reaſon, as in performing his promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> by making <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead Womb to conceive and bring forth: and in performing his threatnings on the wicked, though in their reaſon they do often thing themſelves compaſſed about with Rocks of ſecurity: yet God ſaith, that <hi>Shod</hi> [deſtruction] ſhall come from <hi>Shaddai</hi> [the Almighty] <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>From the Attribute</hi> Adonai, <hi>which is plurall, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, my Pillars, or ſtayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn to reſt and depend upon him for the certaine fulfilling of his promiſes, if we be but rightly qualified according to the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59152:215"/>conditions required of us in his Covenant of Grace, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Adoni Jehonith, what wilt thou give me ſeeing I go childleſs; or ſeeing I am going out of the world childleſs, for I have no hope in nature of a child: but yet notwithſtanding I do call thee Adonai, the Pillar and ſtay of my weak ſaith, in that gracious promiſe now propounded,</hi> in verſe 6: <hi>Feare not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, I am thy ſhield, and thy reward ſhall be exceeding great:</hi> namely, <hi>The Meſſiah ſhall be born from thy loynes; Abraham</hi> replyeth in verſe 2. <hi>Adonai, Jehonith, what will thou give me, ſeeing I go childleſs?</hi> And ſo thoſe ſweet promiſes before given in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.15 of the Meſſiah, ſhall be fruſtrate: but yet I call thee <hi>Adonai, Jehonith,</hi> as ſtill making thee my pillars and ſtaies, and the giver of being to thy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therefore I do by my interrogation expect a further anſwer to ſtay my faith upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Job,</hi> in chap. 28.28. is thus tranſlated by <hi>Bro. Mark. The Feare of Adanai is wiſdome, and to eſchew evill is underſtanding.</hi> His Marginall Note is this; <hi>Adonai</hi> is uſed firſt in Gen. 15.2. of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and is plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for note of Trinity, and ſignifies, My ſtayes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>From the Attribute</hi> Ehieth, <hi>I am, or I will be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn to eſtabliſh our faith in Gods unchangeable promiſes for the good of his Church, and of his threatnings for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is alſo obſervable, that when his promiſes are confirmed with his oath, or confirmed by ſigns, as his promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> was to <hi>Abrah.</hi> poſterity, then God applies his name <hi>Ehieth</hi> to it, as in <hi>Ex.</hi> 3.14. I <hi>am that I am, or I will be that</hi> I <hi>will be:</hi> &amp; ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. God is called, <hi>he that is, and that was, and that will be;</hi> in which word the name <hi>Ehieth</hi> is opened, and alſo the name Jehovah: and it is applicable to the certainty both of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſupport to his faithfull ones under their perſecutors; and alſo to his threatnings of their enemies deſtruction: and the ſame Title is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.5. chiefly to aſſure the godly of thoſe times, of the certain deſtruction of their antichriſtian adverſaries. This Title is alſo given to Jeſus Chriſt, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>From the Attribute</hi> Jah, <hi>Breathing, in</hi> Exod. 15.2.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn, that in <hi>Jah</hi> we live and move and have our breath and being.</p>

Iſrael in their Song of triumph did praiſe God that had given breath and being to them in the midſt of the Red-ſea, and that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the breath and being of <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his Hoſt in the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Attribue do the Saints give, in <hi>Revel</hi> 19.1.3.46, to Chriſt their being, for their deliverance or preſervation from the prevailing power of Antichriſt, ſaying <hi>Halalu-jah.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> in chap. 16.4. doth exhort to faith and confidence in this <hi>Iah;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in</hi> Jah, Jehovah <hi>is the Rock of Ages</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. His Title <hi>Iah,</hi> in <hi>Pſal</hi> 68.4. is there uſed in that exhortation to praiſe God for his mercies by his name <hi>Iah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Title <hi>Halalu jah</hi> is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.35. where the conſuming of ſinners is mentioned, alluding therein to the deſtruction of the Sodomites, and of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt in the Red-ſea, as in <hi>Pſal,</hi> 105.44.45.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This title <hi>Halalu-jab</hi> is alſo uſed in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. where the deſtruction of Antechriſt is foretold.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn, that no Rock is like this Rock; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have right unto him by the Covenant of grace, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him in all ſtraits and temptations for protection and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for this Rock is Chriſt, as it is expounded in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. and and ſo the Rock in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. is not <hi>Peter</hi> but Chriſt; for <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in verſe 10. <hi>Thou art Chriſt:</hi> Chriſts anſwer is, <hi>

               <p n="2">2. The tearm Rock in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5 is by the ſeventy tranſlated <hi>Ctiſtes,</hi> which is tranſlated the (faithfull, or ſure) Creator, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Ghoſai, <hi>a plurall ſignifying My Makers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Hence we may learn, that there is a Trinity of perſons in the Unity of the Godhead: it is uſed in <hi>lob</hi> 35.10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn, that God hath not onely made us to have a being in his viſible Creation, but alſo that he doth make his Elect to have a being in his inviſible Creation, namely to be his people by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59152:216"/>Creation; as the double reading in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.3. doth well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſonſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is moſt uſually applied to the ſecond perſon, becauſe he paid the price of our redemption: But yet redemption is alſo often attributed to the firſt perſon in trinity, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. becauſe all our actuall liberation is from him. The ſecond perſon paid the price; But the actuall Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont by which redemption is compleat, is the act of the firſt perſon: and the qualification that belongeth to the perſons that are to be redeemed, is the act of the third perſon: and in this ſence all the three perſons may be called Redeemers.</p>

               <p>Concluſion.</p>
               <p>Seeing <hi>Elohim</hi> is the mighty Creators, and <hi>Iehovah</hi> is Being of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and giving being to all other things, and the moſt High and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Potentate to maintain and defend his Saints that are in Covenant with him, and ſeeing he is our All ſufficient, four Pillars and ſtay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies unchangable, and ever the ſame, our breath, in whom we live and move and have our being, in whoſe hand is our breath and all our waies; and ſeeing he ſaith, that he is our Father and Redeemer through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant confirmed in the blood of his deare Son, we may well make all the Trinity in that eternall Covenant, to be our Rock and Refuge for our Redemption, Reconciliation, Juſtification, Adoption, and Eternall Salvation, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. From <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.17 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may ſee the reaſon why the Title Jehovah is ſo uſually to be underſtood of Chriſt, except in thoſe places where the Father is diſtinguiſhed, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19 24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. and ſome few other places, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. there Jehovah is ſaid to be in <hi>Iah</hi> [the Father] and our Lord doth thus inſinuate the ſenſe of that and ſuch like places,

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn that all the attributes that are given unto God eſſentially, are likewiſe given to the ſecond and third perſons, as well as to the firſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt is called the Angel that <hi>Jacob</hi> invocated: The Angel that appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.

               <p n="10">10 Chriſt is called the Wiſdome of God, firſt in <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.1. and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is ſo called in the new Teſtament, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.49. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.</p>

Of this mans ſeed, (namely of <hi>Davids</hi> ſeed, as <hi>verſe</hi> 22.) hath God according to his promiſe (in <hi>Eſ.</hi> 11.1, 2.) raiſed or begotten, as it is after expounded, <hi>unto</hi> Iſrael a Saviour Jeſus: and this raiſing he takes up again in verſe 32, 33. We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled unto us their children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus (again) as it is alſo written in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm, Thou art my ſon, this day have</hi> I <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thee</hi> (The word again is not in the <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor in <hi>Ainſ.</hi> who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates the verſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. and being added, it carries the ſenſe to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which is not intended in this verſe, though it be intended in the next verſe) but that which is intended in this verſe, in the beginning of the raiſing up of Chriſt on the ſpirituall throne of <hi>David,</hi> to be a King, Prieſt, and prophet, by his extrinſecall anointing into the Mediatours office, which was not done till he went to <hi>Jordan</hi> to be baptiſed, then the Holy Ghoſt did anoint him viſibly before <hi>Johus</hi> Auditory, by ſitting like the dove upon him, and Chriſts extrinſecall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallment into the Mediatours office is alſo proved by <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. from the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, to day have</hi> I <hi>begotten thee:</hi> hence it is evident, that he called him his ſon, glorified him with the viſible anointing of the holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſme before all <hi>Johns</hi> auditory: and in this reſpect he is ſaid to be his ſon by being begotten extrinſecally into the Mediatours office.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He was alſo begotten from the dead, by the power of God in his Reſurrection, and of this begetting or raiſing up his ſon, the apoſtle alſo ſpeaks in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.30.31, 34. This two-fold raiſing of Chriſt, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. ought to be well marked, becauſe it will then clear the citation of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.7. to be alledged onely for the proof of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his ſon by his extrinſecall inſtallment into the Mediatours office when he began to be 30 years of age, even as <hi>Daniel</hi> was not united to the extrinſecall execution of his Kingly office, untill he was extrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Hence then it follows, that the humane nature, as it was taken into perſonall union with the divine, is called Gods ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. and 22. as it was glorified by his extrinſecall anointing to the publick exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Mediatours office, he is alſo called Gods ſon: <hi>this day have</hi> I <hi>begotten thee, Pſalm</hi> 2.7. and in this ſenſe muſt <hi>Paul</hi> be underſtood in <hi>Heh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Title angel doth ſignifie one ſent on a meſſage: and ſo God ſent forth his ſon to be made (man) of a woman, <hi>Gal</hi> 4 4. but God could not as his ſupream ſend him forth, becauſe the ſecond Perſon thought it no robbery to be equal with God: therefore, in that he was ſent forth, it argues that it was done by his voluntary condeſcention, according to the articles of a mutuall Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is called the angel, or meſſenger of the covenant which God made with fallen man, long before he came in the fleſh, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He did often appear to our Fathers in a moſt excellent ſhape, even as an angel for their direction in matters of faith, and for their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from evill, if they did obey his voice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20, 21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence it is, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, the angel which redemed me out of all adverſity bleſſe the lads, <hi>Gen</hi> 48.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is called the angel of Jehovah in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. <hi>The angel of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah appeared unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in a flame of fire out of the middeſt of</hi> a <hi>bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble buſh,</hi> and this angel in <hi>verſe</hi> 6. calleth himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by this it is evident, that the God which did ſo often appear unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the angel of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſaved them, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 63.9.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. that <hi>Jacob</hi> had power with God, and had power over the angel, and prevailed, he wept and prayed unto him, he found him in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and there he ſpake with us: but in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.34. (from whence this of <hi>Hoſea</hi> is taken) he is called a man; for men that are excellent in form and in qualities, are often called angels, hence it is evident, that it was Chriſt, that did appear both to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to <hi>Jacob</hi> in a moſt excellent humane ſhape, fairer than the ſons of men, as he is ſtiled in <hi>Pſal,</hi> 45.2.2. It was Chriſt wreſtled or combated with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and that ſuffered himſelf to be overcome with <hi>Jacob</hi> for the ſake of his gracious promiſe with <hi>Jacob,</hi> laid hold on by faith, and becauſe that <hi>Jacob</hi> did importunately urge that promiſe in <hi>verſe</hi> 9. for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this angel of Gods preſence was revealed to <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity for their protection, in caſe they did obey his voice, <hi>Exodus</hi> 23.20, 21.</p>

               <p n="2">2. After that Chriſt was pormiſed to come out of <hi>Davids</hi> loins, then <hi>David</hi> proyed unto God in the name of his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> ſometimes he ſaid, O Jehovah, for thy ſervants ſake (as above) and ſometimes for thy Servant <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.32.10. and God doth call his ſon Chriſt his ſervant <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.24. likewiſe he doth call his ſervant Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49 3. and his ſevant <hi>Zorobabel, Hag.</hi> 2.24. and all this muſt be underſtood in relation to his office of Mediatourſhip, and God calls him his ſervant by the name of the aforeſaid perſons, becauſe he was promiſed to come out of their loins, and ſo in <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.8 he is called the branch, my ſervant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks thus to the Jews in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. Firſt unto you hath God raiſed up his ſervant Jeſus: and in verſe 13. the God of our Fathers hath glorified his ſervant Jeſus: ſo <hi>Bro.</hi> doth render it in theſe two verſes.</p>

               <p n="5">5.
